Why does he not,INTERVIEWER, " Because hes the slave,INTERVIEWEE, " Right And I couldnt stand that always And my approach to Tonto is that hes this sort of theres sort of a crazy like a fox stoicism to Tonto you know that that Tonto probably believes that the Lone Ranger is his slave his sidekick So hes like go get me the thing No no no,INTERVIEWER, " Hes going to say no?,INTERVIEWEE, " You go get it You go" Youre the one dressed in the funny outfit You do it,INTERVIEWER, " Are they going to do the beginning where all these bunch of rangers are killed and Tonto saves the Lone Rangers life and ,INTERVIEWEE, " Yes Theres certainly elements of that yes for sure You remember it well,INTERVIEWER, " Oh is there a love interest?,INTERVIEWEE, " Not for Tonto,INTERVIEWER, " I see he doesnt get one,INTERVIEWEE, " Not for Tonto no,INTERVIEWER, " Will you do your own Tonto makeup?,INTERVIEWEE, " Will I do my own Tonto makeup?,INTERVIEWER, " Have you figured out will Tonto one little feather?,INTERVIEWEE, " I think its a little more than that I think Ill tell you what Ill send you a picture of it,INTERVIEWER, " Please,INTERVIEWEE, " Ive done some tests Ill send you a picture of it Because its its a little its a little different than that What I like about Tonto what I feel good about in terms of Tonto is that I feel like hes you know when I when I came up with Captain Jack I thought OK Ive really arrived at something you know different here you know And Tonto feels right on par with Captain Jack It feels like another Captain Jack to me,INTERVIEWER, Are you doing a film about Dr Seuss?,INTERVIEWEE, Its something yes something were developing With Seusss widow you know Guiseles widow And its a very exciting possibility Because its a sort of combination of live action and ,INTERVIEWER, Cat in the Hat?,INTERVIEWEE, Not "Cat in the Hat" so much but the characters The characters will certainly have a role,INTERVIEWER, Thank you Johnny,INTERVIEWEE, Thank you What a pleasure What an honor,INTERVIEWER, Lets go around then,INTERVIEWEE, That was fine really yes,INTERVIEWER, How are you?,INTERVIEWEE, Good,INTERVIEWER, Thank you so much for being on the program tonight This is an exciting night Here’s how dumb I am I didn’t realize that when you wanted to be in show business it was going to be as a musician You are a musician and that’s what you thought you would bea famous whatever musician,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah since I was about twelve,INTERVIEWER, Twelve years old And what are your instruments? Do you play multiple instruments?,INTERVIEWEE, Mostly guitar,INTERVIEWER, You started in Kentucky? Is that where you started?,INTERVIEWEE, Yeahyeah I think it was,INTERVIEWER, And then you went where? Where did you go from Kentucky?,INTERVIEWEE, South Florida,INTERVIEWER, And then you went to Hollywood? Los Angeles?,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah,INTERVIEWER, And you were going to be a music star,INTERVIEWEE, Wellnot necessarily I was going to be a guitar player,INTERVIEWER, Oh not good?,INTERVIEWEE, I was all right,INTERVIEWER, But you’d never thought about acting?,INTERVIEWEE, Never once No,INTERVIEWER, That’s crazy isn’t it?,INTERVIEWEE, Yeahit is now,INTERVIEWER, So what was the turning moment? You’re out there in California you have your guitar and suddenly you’re an actor?,INTERVIEWEE, Well the sudden realization of you know rent Bills You know when that pops in your head you realize that at some point you’ll have to deal with the inevitable,INTERVIEWER, But you know that story often goes the other way Somebody goes out there to be an actor and suddenly they’ve got no money so they go to play the guitar to make money You did it just the opposite!,INTERVIEWEE, Weirdly,INTERVIEWER, How did somebody get your first gig if you were a guitar player? Because that means you weren’t actually out there auditioning,INTERVIEWEE, No uhmy band moved from Florida to Los Angeles,INTERVIEWER, What was the name of the band?,INTERVIEWEE, At the time we were called The Kids,INTERVIEWER, The Kids?,INTERVIEWEE, We actually were kids at the time,INTERVIEWER, And so you and The Kids are out there,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah,INTERVIEWER, Well I mean literally you and The Kids are out there and so then what happens?,INTERVIEWEE, Uh we did some opening act stuff that kind of thing—,INTERVIEWER, Who did you work for?,INTERVIEWEE, Open up for? We did some good shows back at that time—it was like Billy Idol and you know guys like that The Pretenders—,INTERVIEWER, Wow,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah Ramones—,INTERVIEWER, Good gig So then all of a sudden you’re—somebody calls and says what? “I saw you onstage with The Kids?”,INTERVIEWEE, No No I was dead broke you know and I was filling out job applications at variouswell anything Video stores and coffee joints or whatever And a friend of mine who happened to be an actor uhNicolas Cage[smiling] you’ve heard of him—,INTERVIEWER, Yeah How did you and Nicolas Cage get to be buddies in those days?,INTERVIEWEE, He was just sort of around all the people that I was hanging around with and we became pals and he sent me to his agent to—and he said “I think you should try acting” And I met his agent and she sent me to read for something and they hired me,INTERVIEWER, What was that? Do you remember what that was?,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah That was A Nightmare on Elm Street The first one,INTERVIEWER, Whoa! [Audience applause] That was pretty good!,INTERVIEWEE, I was about three when I did that,INTERVIEWER, Later we’ve got a man named Bill Carter who is well known in Texas music and southwestern music or what they call Americana I guess—,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah,INTERVIEWER, A singer-songwriter and you met himwhere? Where did your paths meet?,INTERVIEWEE, Bill and I met—Bill and Ruth Carter—,INTERVIEWER, His wife? Partner?,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah They’re amazing songwriters and I met them when I was doing Gilbert Grape in Austin [audience applause] and we all just hit it off And so they were my kind of saving grace during that period because it was a long movieand so we did the movie and then I moved in with them for a few months,INTERVIEWER, Amazing Your movies are interesting movies and huge commercial successes and rarely do you get that combination consistently,INTERVIEWEE, It’s got nothing to do with me I don’t think,INTERVIEWER, All right Johnny Depp is hereI can’t thank you enough for being here It’s a nice night for us and I hope for you as well because you’re here with your friend—,INTERVIEWEE, Yes sir,INTERVIEWER, and we’re going to hear some music later Let’s talk about The Lone Ranger Oh I’m so excited for this movie I really—this is excellent And you’re not the Lone Ranger,INTERVIEWEE, I’m not,INTERVIEWER, You’re his faithful companion Tonto,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah I play Tonto,INTERVIEWER, Do you mind if I just show these?,INTERVIEWEE, Oh Sure,INTERVIEWER, These are great [Holding up a photo of Johnny as Tonto and Armie Hammer as the Ranger] And then the Lone Ranger iswho’s the Lone Ranger?,INTERVIEWEE, Armie Hammer Yeah—,INTERVIEWER, And that’s you,INTERVIEWEE, —he’s terrific Yeah He’s great,INTERVIEWER, Now as I recall the beginning of the—the genesis of the Lone Ranger is he comes from a dark story And is that the tone of your film?,INTERVIEWEE, Pretty much yeah It comes from a very dark back story anduhhe becomes the Lone Ranger through Tonto’s guidance,INTERVIEWER, Did this mean anything to you when you were a kid? Maybe after the radio broadcast but there was a TV show as welldid you like The Lone Ranger in those days?,INTERVIEWEE, I did I liked watching the series I was always somewhat confused about Tonto’s position I always thought well why does Tonto go in the house and do this? Why is he sending the Indian off to—,INTERVIEWER, Right And is that different in this movie?,INTERVIEWEE, Oh very Yeah It’s very different,INTERVIEWER, This looks like a painting This looks like a Charles Russell rendering doesn’t it? That’s fantastic! [Long audience applause] You look like you know what you’re doing on a horse,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah [Pause] I don’t [Audience laughter] That [indicating the picture] was probably about two-and-a-half seconds before everything went very sideways,INTERVIEWER, Well I’m telling you I mean forget the movie—I’d pay ten bucks just to look at this picture [Johnny laughs] Sobut you ride You don’t ride?,INTERVIEWEE, I haveno no I’ve ridden quite a lot in various movies and stuffand you know growing up in Kentucky you grow up around horses and everything But every horse is different and every movie,INTERVIEWER, You had to ride that horse at top speed?,INTERVIEWEE, Quite a lot Yeah,INTERVIEWER, How did that go?,INTERVIEWEE, It went pretty wellup and to a point Yeah There was one moment in particular where it got unpleasant where the horses had been runningwe’d been running them all day sothey weren’t really interested in slowing down At all So we’re shooting at a different place in the desert where there are all these little [gesturing]bumps and things growing And so my horse that I was on decided to jump a couple of these little obstacles The horse was unaware that the saddle I was wearing to sit on top of it was sort of jerry-riggedkind of faked—,INTERVIEWER, It was to give the effect that you were riding bareback?,INTERVIEWEE, To give the effect that I’m riding bareback So basically it’s not really tight on the horse it’s just enough—,INTERVIEWER, Just a little tissue there for you to sit on—,INTERVIEWEE, A band-aid And when we came down the saddle slipped you know and I went to the left and had the reins here [gesturing] and somehow had the wherewithal to grab the mane of the horseand then the next thing I saw[interrupting himself]all very calm for some reason—I figured that fear would kick in but it didn’t[Audience laughter] I was waitingAll I saw in front of my eyes were these sort of very muscular horse legs and the striations of muscles moving This kind of[pause]death machine And one word popped into my head: hooves You know? Hooves [Audience laughter] In any case hooves Mind the hooves,INTERVIEWER, So what do you do when you’re in that position?,INTERVIEWEE, Well you make a decision Will I go with the beast until someone wrangles it or will I drop? [Audience laughter] It’s a crapshoot,INTERVIEWER, Sure And what did you choose?,INTERVIEWEE, I dropped,INTERVIEWER, I mean you knowwe’re being silly about this but you really could have been seriously seriously injured if not killed,INTERVIEWEE, Horrifically mangled at the very least,INTERVIEWER, You landed on your back? Did you get stepped on?,INTERVIEWEE, I landed on my back Hit the deck pretty hard The one thing that saved me was the horse’s instinct to lift his front legs and go over me,INTERVIEWER, He stepped over you?,INTERVIEWEE, Stepped over me Had he not it was coming straight down into the head,INTERVIEWER, Broken ribs strains bruises anything?,INTERVIEWEE, No He just kind of clipped me with his back legs so it was just a little sore,INTERVIEWER, He just “kind of clipped you with his back legs” Yeah a good horse’ll do that Oh my God But honest to God where are the stunt people for heaven’s sakes? You’re Tonto!,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah,INTERVIEWER, You don’t need that,INTERVIEWEE, That’s the exact same question I asked,INTERVIEWER, Johnny I wanted toyou’re now publishingI know you have a love of books and you have published this New York Times bestseller already This is a lost novel from Woody Guthrie?,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah,INTERVIEWER, About the Dust Bowl?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes,INTERVIEWER, How did you find the transcript of this?,INTERVIEWEE, It came to me through a mutual friend of Hunter Thompson’s and myself this guy named Douglas Brinkley who’s a brilliant writer and historian professorhe’s just amazing So he called me and said “I’ve just been shown the manuscript to Woody Guthrie’s lost novelI think you’re the guy I think we should publish it” And so we went into it and just wanted to make the book as you know beautiful as possible since they’re a dying breed these things,INTERVIEWER, You have plans to publish other volumes different things?,INTERVIEWEE, We have a couple of things in line There’s a thing we’re doing with Bob Dylan which should be interesting,INTERVIEWER, And the other thingLast night we had a group on doing sea chanteys,INTERVIEWEE, Exactly,INTERVIEWER, From—the Americans from a collection of sea chanteys which you producedand not only did I not know that you had produced it this is the second collection of sea chanteys—,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah “Rogues Gallery” and—,INTERVIEWER, This is the “Son of Rogues Gallery”,INTERVIEWEE, “Son of Rogues”,INTERVIEWER, This is music that you came to when you were doing the Pirates of the Caribbean series?,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah on Pirates 1 I was listening to a lot of sea chanteys just to stay in the feel of this and Gore and I—the director and I thought Wow wouldn’t it be great to have contemporary artists do this stuff?,INTERVIEWER, Anytime I’ve seen you—in a trailer at your home in a hotel room—you always have at least one guitar with you You sometimes talk while strumming a guitar How connected are you with music?,INTERVIEWEE, It’s still my first love as much as it ever was since I was a little kid and first picked up a guitar and tried to figure out how to make the thing go Going into acting was an odd deviation from a particular road that I was on in my late teens early 20s because I had no desire no interest really in it at all I was a musician and I was a guitarist and that’s what I wanted to do But because of that deviation and because I don’t do it for a living maybe I still have been able to maintain that kind of innocent love for it The weird thing is I think I approach my work the same way I approached guitar playing—looking at a character like a song If you think of expression musically—it goes from wherever it comes from inside to your fingers and on to that fretboard and then on to the amplifier through whatever It’s the same kind of thing that’s required here with acting: What was the author’s intent? What can I add to it that maybe someone else won’t add to it? It’s not necessarily a question of how many notes but a question of what do the notes express and what does a slight bend do,INTERVIEWER, I overheard someone in your camp—maybe it was on the set of The Rum Diary or maybe it was The Tourist—talking about how eager you were to get back to Captain Jack and about how much Jack was like you How do you feel when you enter into the skin of Captain Jack?,INTERVIEWEE, Free—free to be irreverent I think it’s like unlocking a part of yourself and freeing this part of yourself to just be—what do they call it?—the id or whatever just to bejust to be under whatever circumstances The closest thing that I can compare it to was having known Hunter Thompson really well—we were very very close—and witnessing him because I studied him so deeply and lived with him for a period of time to try to become Raoul Duke to try to become Hunter There was a certain freedom that he had or control or command of the situation—there was never anything that he couldn’t get through Verbally he was just so clever and so quick and so free and he didn’t give a rat’s ass about what the repercussions were,INTERVIEWER, He was the revolutionary’s Johnny Carson I mean he always had a punch line,INTERVIEWEE, Somebody once asked him “What is the sound of one hand clapping Hunter?” and he smacked him Captain Jack was kind of like that for me an opening up of this part of yourself that is somewhat—you know there is a little Bugs Bunny in all of us,INTERVIEWER, Young kids love—really love—the Captain And who is more mystically mischievous and brilliant in his own way than Bugs Bunny?,INTERVIEWEE, At the time I had been watching nothing but cartoons with my daughter—with Lily Rose I hadn’t seen a grown-up film in forever It was all cartoons all those great old Warner Bros things And I thought Jesus the parameters here are so much wider and more forgiving in terms of character These cartoon characters could get away with anything And I thought They’re beloved by 3-year-olds and 93-year-olds How do you do that? How do you get there? That was kind of the start,INTERVIEWER, I also see a little bit of John Barrymore in Captain Jack There’s humor and often a feyness He keeps his intelligence in his own little treasure chest He doesn’t really want people to comprehend that he knows everything,INTERVIEWEE, He has already assessed the situation,INTERVIEWER, What were you reading to inform you about Captain Jack’s life or his lifestyle?,INTERVIEWEE, I was reading a lot of books about early pirates There was one book in particular that was really helpful called Under the Black Flag You realize that those guys were—you either loved it or you were press-ganged and you didn’t One of the things that helped me most with Captain Jack was a book by Bernard Moitessier and it’s where I found the last line for the first Pirates movie The writers were stumped and they’d say Well what about this? And nothing seemed to click I was reading this Moitessier book on sailing the earth and he had written about how the ultimate for a sailor was the horizon and to be able to attain that horizon which you never get to which is why it keeps pushing you forward I thought That’s it! That’s it! So I went to them and said I’ve got a line for you: “Bring me that horizon” And they looked at it and went Nah that’s not it But about 45 minutes later they came to me and went That’s the line,INTERVIEWER, Because delivered in a certain way,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah—“Bring me that horizon” That’s what they all want That’s what all those guys want Get me that horizon And you never get there,INTERVIEWER, How did Disney feel about Captain Jack? He does have a wisp of controversy about him,INTERVIEWEE, It was a totally different regime over there at the time They couldn’t stand him They just couldn’t stand him I think it was Michael Eisner the head of Disney at the time who was quoted as saying “He’s ruining the movie” It was that extreme—memos and paper trails and madness and phone calls and agents and lawyers and people screaming and me getting phone calls direct from you know upper-echelon Disney-ites going What’s wrong with him? Is he you know like some kind of weird simpleton? Is he drunk? By the way is he gay? Is he this? Is he that? And so I actually told this woman who was the Disney-ite that called me about all that stuff and asked me the questions I said to her “But didn’t you know that all my characters are gay?” Which really made her nervous,INTERVIEWER,The role of Frank in The Tourist is so different from the Hatter or the Captain—more subtle Characters like him—who seem to have less that you can grasp—I would think would be harder to do,INTERVIEWEE, The great challenge of a character like Frank for me is that he’s Everyman you know Mr Ordinary—not a simpleton just ordinary He’s a math teacher I was always fascinated by people who are considered completely normal because I find them the weirdest of all,INTERVIEWER, So where did you find Frank?,INTERVIEWEE, He was sort of a combo platter for me from certain people I’ve known over the years I knew an accountant who would travel—he was super-straight very very straight guy—and he would travel all over the world to photograph places that had street signs or businesses that had the same name as his last name He’d go to Italy he’d go to Shanghai and he’d take photographs That was his kick,INTERVIEWER, He had an eccentricity that no one sees Everyone sees the eccentricities of an artist But eccentricities like Frank’s are so subtle and so particular,INTERVIEWEE, It was guys like that that I thought about Frank for example who had quit smoking could be absolutely fascinated with that electronic cigarette and the moving parts of it and being able to really explain it to someone in great detail,INTERVIEWER, Frank has some really nice pajamas Cotton Light blue Do you wear pajamas?,INTERVIEWEE, Occasionally I do Occasionally when it’s cold,INTERVIEWER, Do they have feet on them?,INTERVIEWEE, I don’t have the feet I have not gone for footed pajamas yet However I’m not—I wouldn’t you know withdraw the idea One of the finest nights of sleep that I ever had after a huge workload was in a pair of pajamas that Julian Schnabel gave me I hadn’t worn pajamas since I was about three And I actually slept in them They were somehow so comforting His wife made them That was the moment when I became completely square,INTERVIEWER, Well I don’t know I’ve also seen your Miami Dolphins socks—although that might be a secret,INTERVIEWEE, You have a pair too! There are no secrets now We’re in this together,INTERVIEWER, We have another dirty little secret A Monkees song,INTERVIEWEE, Oh “Daydream Believer” It’s a great song I don’t care what anyone says,INTERVIEWER, “Daydream Believer” came on the radio when we were driving to the set It was a moment of total happiness It’s a pure happy little song What bad thing can you say about it?,INTERVIEWEE, I know I know It’s OK to like “Daydream Believer” There’s nothing wrong with a guilty pleasure from time to time Know what I mean? It’s “Daydream Believer” I’m justifying my own flag,INTERVIEWER, A Monkee and I have the same birthday,INTERVIEWEE, Is it Micky Dolenz?,INTERVIEWER, No it’s actually two Monkees Mike and Davy I used to be horrified by that fact but now I don’t care anymore I have the same birthday as Bo Diddley Rudyard Kipling and Paul Bowlesand two Monkees,INTERVIEWEE, That’s pretty good That’s a good balance,INTERVIEWER, Getting back to The Tourist from what I saw on set the atmosphere seemed fraught with mischief,INTERVIEWEE, Angelina—we’d met basically on this film Meeting her and getting to know her was a real pleasant surprise and I say that with the best meaning just in the sense that she’s this quite you know famous and I mean poor thing dogged by paparazzi her and her husband Brad you know and all their kids and their wonderful life but they are plagued byso you don’t know what to expect really You don’t know what she might be like—if she has any sense of humor at all I was so pleased to find that she is incredibly normal and has a wonderfully kind of dark perverse sense of humor And because here we are working together in this situation where you could really—there are times when you see how ridiculous is this life how ludicrous it is you know leaving your house every morning and being followed by paparazzi or having to hide sometimes not even being able to talk to each other in public because someone will take a photograph and it will be misconstrued and turned into some other shit,INTERVIEWER, On set I told her that she looked beautiful and she explained to me about all the different people it takes to make that possible—as if she really isn’t I found Angelina interesting If you talk about her beauty she scoffs If you mention a cause she invites you to take a stand,INTERVIEWEE, That’s the thing with Angie I mean you look at her and you go OK: “goddess” “movie icon” In 30 years people will still be going “Oh my God” Elizabeth Taylor kind of territory And she has got that no question about it But like anything it’s the way she deals with it She’s so down to earth and so bright and so real I’ve had the honor and the pleasure and gift of having known Elizabeth Taylor for a number of years Who’s a real broad You know you sit down with her she slings hash she sits there and cusses like a sailor and she’s hilarious Angie’s got the same kind of thing you know the same approach,INTERVIEWER, Something I’ve always wondered about is: these people that you become for us or make flesh in a film—do they revisit you ever? Are you able to discard them? What happens to them?,INTERVIEWEE, They’re all still there which on some level can’t be the healthiest thing in the world But no they’re all still there I always picture it as this chest of drawers in your body—Ed Wood is in one the Hatter is in another Scissorhands is in another They stick with you Hunter is certainly in there—you know Raoul Duke The weirdest thing is that I can access them They’re still very close to the surface,INTERVIEWER, It must be difficult when you have multiple personalities in one of them like the Hatter has What does he say “It’s crowded in here”?,INTERVIEWEE, “I don’t like it in here It’s terribly crowded” But they all somehow have their place They have come to terms with each other I suppose,INTERVIEWER, When you’re playing someone—when you’re really deep within a character—have you ever had a dream that you felt was not your dream? Do your characters dream within you?,INTERVIEWEE, I’ve certainly had dreams where I was the character Sweeney was like that There were a lot of dark Sweeney dreams And certainly The Libertine playing John Wilmot,INTERVIEWER, I would think that Wilmot would be the one who would most desire to rear his head He was a real human being It’s one thing to interpret a character in literature or someone in fiction But to have to channel someone who was a living person Did you find that process different?,INTERVIEWEE, It’s definitely different The first thing is the responsibility You have a responsibility to that person and the legacy and memory of that person So especially playing someone like John Wilmot the Earl of Rochester because I always felt he was this great great poet who was never acknowledged as a great poet but looked upon as a satirist or some silly guy who hung around the court of King Charles II I never believed he got his due He was a renegade a brilliant poet who was incredibly brave I felt this very strong responsibility to play him right—so much so that I became obsessed I read everything I knew everything about him I went to the places he’d lived I went to the place where he died I perused his actual letters in the British Library and found his words and made notes and used them in the script Without wanting to sound all kind of New Agey I do believe that he paid me at least a few visits,INTERVIEWER, When you spouted a few lines of poetry to Samantha Morton who played Elizabeth Barry in the movie—that was my introduction to Wilmot’s work to his poetry And I noticed in Alice when the Hatter recites “Jabberwocky” that you have a gift for giving us the full measure of a poet’s work It is really quite difficult Could you imagine doing a recording of works of poetry?,INTERVIEWEE, I don’t know It’s daunting because you don’t know exactlyI mean you can decipher the intent and you can kind of swim around in the guts of it but you just don’t know how the poet would have wanted it read,INTERVIEWER, Yes but that’s no different than Glenn Gould having to anticipate how Bach would want his work played I thought the Hatter’s reading of “Jabberwocky” was luminous Yesterday you read me a poem written by the Elephant Man I didn’t know he wrote poetry The poem you recited was heartbreaking How did you come to find it?,INTERVIEWEE, I made an appointment at the hospital where they had his remains His skeleton is there a plaster mask is there and his hat and veil and all this other stuff is there And right on the wall next to him is this gorgeous poem that he wrote about himself and about his life: “Dragging this vile body / Round the years / I am not what first appears / A senseless freak / Devoid of hope or tears” This guy was deep and so so gifted,INTERVIEWER, I’ve seen The Libertine a number of times The cinematography the direction the script—it was all so beautiful The costumes the casting the women—they were superb John Malkovich was a great person for you to work off of But it seemed buried as a film,INTERVIEWEE, It was buried no question It was buried horribly It was a conflict within the ranks I wanted to go to the artist Banksy the English graffiti artist I was going to make a plea to him What I wanted was the image the spray-painted image of John Wilmot’s face to show up here and there simply with the line from the movie the phrase “You will not like me” “You will not like me”—I thought That’s the way to go with something like this But the reaction was “Banksy who?”,INTERVIEWER, Do you have any actors that you studied from the past actors from any era who were helpful either in a specific role or just in general? ,INTERVIEWEE, The guys I always adored were mostly the silent-film actors Buster Keaton first Lon Chaney Sr and Chaplin of course—those three for me And John Barrymore The gods: those are the gods And then you’ve got the people that came out of that Paul Muni certainlyBut Marlon it wasn’t until Marlon Brando came along thatit was revolutionary it just changed everything The work he was doing Streetcar—completely different fucking animal And everybody changed their approach from that moment on,INTERVIEWER, He was bigger than—I don’t know how to say it—it was almost like the screen could not contain him Does that make sense?,INTERVIEWEE, Absolutely I don’t know what the fuck it is or was but at that time—especially at that time—he had too much And the shape of his face and his nose and his—and the distance between his forehead and his eyebrows and whatever was going on for whatever genetic reason or whatever He was placed in that spot for that particular thing And man he cranked it He just absolutely owned it,INTERVIEWER, It’s interesting when one individual—whether it’s Michelangelo Coltrane Bob Dylan Jackson Pollock—they’re so inspiring and they help beget almost a whole school but no one can touch them They have this place of kingship but also solitude,INTERVIEWEE, And Marlon hated it He hated it which is probably why he rejected the whole idea of it you know and made fun of it But I know it’s bullshit I know he was capable of the work and worked hard when he did the work I saw him do it you know He did care,INTERVIEWER, Earlier you mentioned those three greats the silent-film greats You’re a master of language voice script words And yet you chose three silent-film actors,INTERVIEWEE, The amazing thing about those guys is that they didn’t have the luxury of language So what they were doing what they were feeling what they were trying to express had to come out through being had to be alive had to be in there behind the eyes Their body had to express it their very being had to express it,INTERVIEWER, Throughout your life you seem to have had beautiful relationships with a succession of mentors—Marlon Hunter Allen Ginsberg You hold these people with you Is that something that has just come your way? Or is it something that you seek in life?,INTERVIEWEE, I think it’s probably a combination It’s never been a conscious sort of searching but it did happen with these guys The combination probably goes back to memories of my grandfather We were very very close and I lost him I was about nine,INTERVIEWER, Is it your grandfather you have tattooed on your arm?,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah Jim He was a wonderful model He drove a bus during the day and ran moonshine at night He was a Robert Mitchum type a man’s man He just said things as they were He’d call a spade a spade—and piss on you if you don’t like it He was also of a different era—I mean a radically different era as were some of the other guys that we’ve talked about like Marlon and Hunter and even Keith [Richards] to some degree and Allen certainly I really believe it was a better time I really believe that at a certain point if you’re born in ‘60-something or whatever you got ripped off—you know what I mean? I always felt like I was meant to have been born in another era another time,INTERVIEWER, I was thinking back on Edward Scissorhands—he has this father figure and mentor Vincent Price’s character You told me a story once about Vincent Price,INTERVIEWEE, We were doing Scissorhands and Vincent was playing the inventor—essentially my father in the film And he was a decent man He was able to move around He was cool He was old,INTERVIEWER, Was that his last film?,INTERVIEWEE, I think it was yes I think it was his last,INTERVIEWER, Such a beautiful film to end with,INTERVIEWEE, And the same kind of genre that he dwelled in for a long time I adored him As did Tim a long time before me So we spent time together hung out I was totally enamored And I had this volume of Edgar Allan Poe Tales of Mystery and Imagination that I wanted to show him just show him you know because I love the illustrations by Harry Clarke I brought it to Vincent and we were sitting in his trailer He says Oh yes this is wonderful it’s a wonderful book He was leafing beautifully through these great heavy pages And he found “The Tomb of Ligeia” and started to read from it And he read about half a page aloud maybe And then he closed the book and continued He knew it verbatim,INTERVIEWER, In his handwriting?,INTERVIEWEE, Handwriting watercolors—the Book of Dreams It was right there little notepads tiny little steno notebooks that he carried in his back pocket I read cover to cover as many as I could And opened up suitcases of his that hadn’t been opened for years All these amazing things John Sampas gave me a coat so we could walk to the cemetery to visit Kerouac’s grave And the coat he put on me was Jack’s A black raincoat three-quarter length slight check in it I reached into the pockets In the right-hand pocket there was a tissue just some old wadded-up tissue And on the left-hand side there was an old matchbook And I thought you know OK I’ve touched these It’s like the Smithsonian Institution was in my pockets you know?,INTERVIEWER, Are you reading anything right now? Well you’re always reading so I should say what are you reading right now?,INTERVIEWEE, Between scripts I’m reading The Thin Man the Dashiell Hammett book to see what we can mine from it That’s something that would be Rob [Marshall] directing and me playing the Nick part My hope is that Penélope [Cruz] would play the part of Nora,INTERVIEWER, And what script are you reading?,INTERVIEWEE, The most recent draft of Dark Shadows That’s something I want to do The script is close now really close and you know it’s just a question of myself and Tim and the writer basically the three of us getting together and signing off on various scenarios But it’s really gotten good In the last three weeks it’s gotten fuckin’ good,INTERVIEWER, Do you ever think of doing plays? I think it would be wonderful to see you work live,INTERVIEWEE, I do I do I do The bitter pill that I swallowed was with Marlon who asked how many movies I did a year And I said I don’t know—three? He said You ought to slow down kid You’ve got to slow down ‘cause we only have so many faces in our pockets And then he went on to say Why don’t you just take a year and go and study Shakespeare or go and study Hamlet Go and work on Hamlet and play that part Play that part before you’re too old I thought Well yeah yeah I know Hamlet Great What a great part great play you know this and that And then the killer came He said “I never did it I never got the chance to do it Why don’t you go and do it?” He was the one that should’ve done it and he didn’t He didn’t So what he was trying to tell me was: play that fucking part man Play that part before you’re too long in the tooth Play it And I would like to I’d really really like to,INTERVIEWER, Tim Burton says the dark films youve made together have been a form of therapy. Would you agree?,INTERVIEWEE, I guess it is kind of therapeutic to go in and make an ass of yourself and get paid for it. Theres something to be said for that. As an actor with any character you play you have to bring as much of your own truth to the character as possible. And then you make an ass of yourself.,INTERVIEWER, How easy was it getting into the character of Willy Wonka?,INTERVIEWEE, Well obviously were all very lucky to have the book as our source material. Using Roald Dahls work was an amazing help in building the character. And then it was really just down to conversations with Tim. We talked about various things like memories of growing up of childrens show hosts. That strange cadence with which they spoke to children “Hello kiddies;” and game show hosts with that kind of mask they put on like a perpetual grimace. We went from there.,INTERVIEWER, Did you draw on any one person?,INTERVIEWEE, There was this guy called Captain Kangaroo. Even then it was strange but if you go back now and watch it its really out there. He had his pal Mr. Green Jeans and Bunny Rabbit. So it was memories of watching those guys as a child the game show guys who were always smiling. But no one specific.,INTERVIEWER, What about the resemblance between Willy Wonka and Michael Jackson?,INTERVIEWEE, Honestly when we were doing the film it never dawned on me that there would be any comparisons made. I dont know what more I can say about that.,INTERVIEWER, What else did you do to develop the character?,INTERVIEWEE, For me when Im reading a script I start getting images you know—ideas start coming into my head so I write everything down. The hairdo I saw early on but it took a long time before I could see or hear Wonka. I dont know thats pretty much it. You build layer upon layer as you find him. Even when we started shooting it probably took me about ten days to really feel like I clicked with the guy. The false teeth were very helpful.,INTERVIEWER, Have your children seen all your films?,INTERVIEWEE, Some of them yeah. Im not sure my kids are ready for all of them. They saw Charlie and the Chocolate Factory which made me nervous because I was scared they were going to come home and just go “Nah Dad better luck next time.” But they came home quoting it which was really nice.,INTERVIEWER, If you were as poor as Charlie Bucket is in the film do you think you could be happy?,INTERVIEWEE, When I was growing up we werent particularly overflowing with money. I never expected to last so long in this racket to be honest. I always expected to go back to playing guitar and pumping gas or whatever. And it still could happen. As long as you have the ability to breathe and life for your kids and your girl you just keep moving forward.,INTERVIEWER, So whats next for you?,INTERVIEWEE, Well at the moment Im on hiatus from shooting Pirates 2 and 3. Thats going well so far—I havent been fired which is good. And I made a film last year called The Libertine which is coming out next in December I think. Thats pretty much it at the moment.,INTERVIEWER, Have you always been interested in the dark side of life?,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah yeah. I'm interested in extremes of all kinds you know. The dark side the light side the negative and the positive. I don't know why. Human behavior really is the most fascinating thing.,INTERVIEWER, What do you think of the view that The Ripper was the very first tabloid star?,INTERVIEWEE, I agree with it. He was perversely elevated to the status of celebrity. It was the first time that had happened. The Ripper case in a way gave birth to tabloid journalism.,INTERVIEWER, From Hell is a classic London story. But where did you film it?,INTERVIEWEE, The Czech Republic! I really don't know why. All I know is that when I arrived in the Czech Republic they drove me about 30-40 minutes outside Prague to the studio and they had built 8-10 blocks of Whitechapel 1888 in staggering detail in the middle of a field.,INTERVIEWER, So what was it like to be standing there to suddenly be transported back in time?,INTERVIEWEE, It was extremely bizarre. The day before I'd been to Whitechapel in London and had visited the 10 Bells and the various murder sites the church and the general neighborhood. And then the next day I'm standing in the exact same spot except one hundred and something years earlier. It was so beautifully done. The detail was amazing.,INTERVIEWER, Do you mean you went on The Ripper Tour?,INTERVIEWEE, Kind of. I went with one of the experts the Ripper-ologists. He took me on the walk and explained all the details because a lot of the murder sites are now gone. There are buildings on top of them.,INTERVIEWER, We hear that you hang out in London quite a lot and we were wondering why you particularly like the city?,INTERVIEWEE, It's easy to like it just look at it! It's an amazing place amazing people. When we did Sleepy Hollow I was here for six months and that was one of the greatest times I've ever had. It's beautiful it's got great history great people an interesting culture the list is endless.,INTERVIEWER, And is it right that you're going to open a bar here?,INTERVIEWEE, I just heard that today and that's the first I'd heard of it! A couple of people have said to me “How's the bar going?” and I thought they meant The Viper Room in Los Angeles. I'm always coming across small fictions like that about me. It's part of the deal I guess.,INTERVIEWER, So let's talk about Robbie Coltrane—you've said he's your hero—why do you think he's such a cool guy?,INTERVIEWEE, He's the perfect example of what a man should be. He's a great man a loyal man he's a great actor a great comedian a beautiful friend a beautiful father. He's amazing. I'm going to call him 'BAFTA Coltrane' from now on. I'm sure he'll clean up at the Academy Awards.,INTERVIEWER, On the set of From Hell you had Robbie from Harry Potter and Ian Holm from Lord Of The Rings. Did you find out much insider gossip from those films?,INTERVIEWEE, Ian showed me these photographs of himself in his prosthetic makeup which was pretty impressive. And I got a few Harry Potter stories out of old Coltrane. But I still haven't seen the films yet. I don't go to the movies so much. They'll come around at some point. I prefer the comfort of ignorance in terms of the industry. I don't like knowing which movies are making money. I don't like knowing what the new thing is who's popular who's not popular. I find great comfort in not knowing these things.,INTERVIEWER, What interested you about From Hell?,INTERVIEWEE, I thought the script was amazing and I’m a big fan of the Hughes Brothers. I loved their last film (American Pimp) and I loved working with them. I also got the chance to smoke a lot in this movie like in Blow. I don’t need an excuse to smoke in a film.,INTERVIEWER, You were interested in Jack the Ripper as a child?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes I was very fascinated by the subject of Jack the Ripper I was obsessed maybe I was too interested in him at such a young age. From then on I just found as much information on the subject as I could over the years. It’s the first recorded serial killer in history and the fact that’s it’s never been properly solved is really fascinating. Nothing like this had happened before on such a large scale and it’s still an unsolved case and it’s a case that will likely never fully be solved.,INTERVIEWER, Abberline is a very sick tortured man in the film? Tell us how you approached the character.,INTERVIEWEE, Even in the deepest and darkest kinds of things I try to find some humor and extract it. The character I play Abberline feels like he sees demons and visions in his search for Jack the Ripper. He’s a very damaged man so in a way from my point of view it would make sense to show all of his scars and weaknesses. He has all of these demons he abuses drugs you show the addictions and the demons—as well as the hunt for the killer.,INTERVIEWER, You did a lot of research for this role didn’t you?,INTERVIEWEE, One of the things I was able to do was actually go and visit Whitechapel and see the real places where the killings took place. I also got to talk to all of these ‘Ripperologists’ and hear all of these theories about who Jack the Ripper may have been. One of the Jack the Ripper experts he took me to all of the notorious landmarks where all the murders happened.,INTERVIEWER, What did the Hughes Brothers bring to the film?,INTERVIEWEE, They knew every theory in the film. They’re great. They know everything about what they’re doing. They study scenes. They told me that they had reconstructed Whitechapel for the movie but I didn’t know just how far they had gone. It turns out you could see seven or eight blocks of the East End of London. It felt like stepping back into time. I was so impressed with the research they had done for the film. It was like watching someone solve a hard equation.,INTERVIEWER, Why is the legend of the Jack the Ripper still so fascinating?,INTERVIEWEE, It was the first case where a faceless killer had been elevated to the status of pulp icon. He became a worldwide curiosity.,INTERVIEWER, So From Hell was a much happier experience than The Astronaut’s Wife and The Ninth Gate?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, Tell us a little about working with Tim Burton.,INTERVIEWEE, I’d love to work with Tim again. Tim’s a true artist very true to his artistic vision to his emotions. He’s proved that you can do things differently and still be successful. On Sleepy Hollow I thought I was going to get fired because I didn’t think there was any way they were going to let me play the character that way but Tim was very supportive. The same was true with the Hughes Brothers. Anything they did I’d work with them again.,INTERVIEWER, Jerry Seinfeld. He has kept one of Hollywood's most buzzed about secrets until tonight. The comic reveals the true identity,INTERVIEWEE, It's like not even know just total shock.,INTERVIEWER, Someone we've only read about.,INTERVIEWEE, It was a nom de plume.,INTERVIEWER, One of the funniest men on the planet is here.,INTERVIEWEE, I mean I think missing in the show is a menu.,INTERVIEWER, Good evening. I have to say this? Jerry Seinfeld is an actor author director and comedian.,INTERVIEWEE, Keep going.,INTERVIEWER, I'm telling you you may not know who he is. He is making his Broadway directing debut with comedian Colin Quinn's one-man show "Long Story Short History of the World in 75 Minutes." And he wrote the forward to an all-new "Letters From A Nut" one of the funniest books you will ever read. And tonight he will reveal the secret author a little later Jerry has been a frequent guest long-time friend to this show. Watch. We'll show you some examples.,INTERVIEWEE, Look at this piece of junk. Look at it Give me a camera. Look at this. This is like you know this like a 4.95 opening act. You're a headliner now. This is a nice weather map you have here. This looks like a game of risk.,INTERVIEWER, What about financial success? I mean you don't have financial worries?,INTERVIEWEE, No.,INTERVIEWER, How's that changed you? You can buy anything you see.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, OK.,INTERVIEWEE, I want that clock. Here's the question.,INTERVIEWER, Go ahead.,INTERVIEWEE, Who's the victim? Where's the victim here? You're all a victim.,INTERVIEWER, This looks like QVC doesn't it? What else Jerry? What else?,INTERVIEWEE, That's not all you get. You get the knives.,INTERVIEWER, What do you make of our earlier conversation which bumped you 20 minutes?,INTERVIEWEE, Well I can't tell you how flattered I am that it takes the president's genitals to push me back 20 minutes. I mean that's how big a star I am. Let's tell them about this movie. That shot of you and Cattenburg (ph) nose to nose,INTERVIEWER, Historically.,INTERVIEWEE, I have not seen that since I left Hebrew school. You know I have a Larry King in the human world too.,INTERVIEWER, It's a common name. Next week on the larry king.,INTERVIEWEE, No no I mean he looks like you. He has a show with suspenders and different color of dots behind him,INTERVIEWER, Next week on the Larry king.,INTERVIEWEE, Old-guy glasses and these quotes along the bottom from the guest you're watching even though you just heard him. It's not even a new one. Do you tape this in your luggage? Oh boy. What a budget. Goodbye clock. Get another one.,INTERVIEWER, We used to have a little clock in there. We used it frequently until Seinfeld's last appearance then we couldn't afford another. Why did you take our clock?,INTERVIEWEE, Larry this is my final appearance on the larry king LIVE show.,INTERVIEWER, Because larry king LIVE leaves in December.,INTERVIEWEE, No. You will be here. I'm going.,INTERVIEWER, Oh I see.,INTERVIEWEE, And because this is my final appearance.,INTERVIEWER, No.,INTERVIEWEE, I have in my hand.,INTERVIEWER, What?,INTERVIEWEE, A clock that I'm going to give you. It's the cheapest clock I could find. It's $3. But I wanted a clock that looked most like the clock that you usually have on this show which I could never even conceive that you don't know what time it is or you need toso I'm replacing the clocks that I have been stealing all these years. I'm putting one down. And it got a snooze. Can you get a shot of that? It got a snooze because when you get older that's what counts.,INTERVIEWER, This clock shall be a permanent part of larry king LIVE. It shall be embellished in our hearts.,INTERVIEWEE, At the Smithsonian.,INTERVIEWER, And will go to Smithsonian when we send the set over. By the way what prompted you to take it the first time?,INTERVIEWEE, It's just annoying that a big-time big-shot guy like you has a piece of Chazarai (ph) like that. It offended me. Chazarai by the way is an inexpensive item.,INTERVIEWER, That's correct. You're going to put the rumors to rest tonight about who wrote "Letters From A Nut.",INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, Who was identified as Ted L. Nancy which of course was a nom de plume.,INTERVIEWEE, It was a nom of plume. Now this idea of this character started 15 years ago. And when the idea arose we decided to keep it a secret who was writing these letters. ,INTERVIEWER, And tonight we'll meetTonight you're going to meet the person who has conceived of this entire character. And it was really thought ofwe did it as kind of a gag just for ourselves to have fun and the books took off. And there's been I think four or five of them now. They've best sellers and it was never intended to be that. The trouble with the book and just called trouble is you can't read it without breaking up. I mean we'll read some letters later. This guy fiction (ph) writes crazy letters to people.,INTERVIEWEE, And they answer him.,INTERVIEWER, He writes to hotels businesses corporations.,INTERVIEWEE, Because people are so afraid of offending a customer now. No matter what he asks them for they say well we don't know if we can have 10000,INTERVIEWER, We'll reveal that in a little while. Why did you choose larry king LIVE to reveal it?,INTERVIEWEE, I have to be honest with you.,INTERVIEWER, Please.,INTERVIEWEE, This is the funniest show on TV.,INTERVIEWER, What?,INTERVIEWEE, This show makes no sense. That you sit here and ask these questions night after night and nobody answers them and nobody cares. And it goes on and on and on and you sit here and you look like you're ready to order. This is what this show looks like to me on TV is a guy in a deli waiting to order. To me the only thing missing on the show is a menu. I always think you're going to look up and go "is the corned beef lean? Is it lean?",INTERVIEWER, So you have chosen us?,INTERVIEWEE, Because this show is funny. Do I want to do the "60 Minutes" funny?,INTERVIEWER, No.,INTERVIEWEE, No.,INTERVIEWER, So you see me with President Carter you laugh?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, You laugh? ,INTERVIEWEE, Yes. Because it'syou knowyou're like an uncle that cornered somebody at a Thanksgiving dinner and you just start peppering them with questions and they're lookingthey're holding a piece of cake and they can't get away. And you keep asking them questions and they're avoiding the answers and that's who you are. You're like an annoying relative that people love but you're annoying. OK. Youby the way I was honored to appear in "Bee Movie." I loved you in "Bee Movie." Let me tell you why you were in "Bee Movie." First of all you have been in more movies ,INTERVIEWER, 26 I think.,INTERVIEWEE, Than any talk show host.,INTERVIEWER, Correct. I have that record.,INTERVIEWEE, And that is because the show makes no sense.,INTERVIEWER, That's why they want me.,INTERVIEWEE, That's why they want you. But there's something about we thought if there was a fantasy universe where bees lives when talked like people no matter what universe you could conceive of there would be some version of Larry King there. That's how Omni present you are.,INTERVIEWER, Omni present?,INTERVIEWEE, You're so much a part of culture. The idea of a world with no Larry King is inconceivable which is why CNN will change their mind before this season is over before what is it December 18th?,INTERVIEWER, 16th.,INTERVIEWEE, 16th. It will go to the 18th. That's how strong you're,INTERVIEWER, You're on a role man. By the way you directed me in "Bee Movie.",INTERVIEWEE, I did.,INTERVIEWER, And of all the movies I do you were the most maybe next to Warren Beatty in "Bulworth" who drove me crazy.,INTERVIEWEE, Right.,INTERVIEWER, You were the most involved director changing scripts little lines.,INTERVIEWEE, I'm a nuts. ,INTERVIEWER, We were whole day with it.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes. I noticed. II wantedI wantedyou weren't quite giving me Larry King.,INTERVIEWER, That's right. You needed more.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes. It's too much Larry not enough King. Too much King. Less Larry.,INTERVIEWER, Will you do a sequel?,INTERVIEWEE, To "Bee Movie"?,INTERVIEWER, Yes.,INTERVIEWEE, No.,INTERVIEWER, Why not?,INTERVIEWEE, I loved it. In case you haven't noticed if you look at my career and you see what I do being a standup comedian aside I do things and then I just walk away. Have you noticed that? And I never go back. Do you think I'll do another sitcom?,INTERVIEWER, No.,INTERVIEWEE, No. Can we roll the clip by the way of you asking me it was my favorite one one of your producers asked me what was my favorite moment of being on larry king. My favorite moment was when you asked me if my show was canceled. Do you remember that?,INTERVIEWER, And you got ticked.,INTERVIEWEE, No. I was joking.,INTERVIEWER, You were acting yes.,INTERVIEWEE, But it was a big internet sensation you know.,INTERVIEWER, I know.,INTERVIEWEE, Because people thought that I really was upset.,INTERVIEWER, But yes you did it pretty good and then we were on Conan the next night. Both of us were on Conan.,INTERVIEWEE, That's right.,INTERVIEWER, That's too funny. The cast of "Seinfeld" recently reunited on "Curb Your Enthusiasm." Let's take a look at some behind the scenes footage as they all walk onto the set.,INTERVIEWEE, It was a year ago.,INTERVIEWER, What was that like to go back?,INTERVIEWEE, It was mind boggling. It was mind boggling because you know they rebuilt the set and we were all there. And so you know this is 12 years ago. You walk away. It's like if you go back to your old neighborhood you can see the neighborhood but if you go back to your old house it's not the same. So it was the same. So we got to really go back in time.,INTERVIEWER, How do you explain the success of "Curb Your Enthusiasm"?,INTERVIEWEE, Just really a show.,INTERVIEWER, It's brilliant.,INTERVIEWEE, It's a brilliant show. And Larry has all the gifts you know? He knows how to write. He knows how to cast. He is funny himself you know. It's one of my favorite shows.,INTERVIEWER, How did "Seinfeld" come about?,INTERVIEWEE, It came about because NBC had talked to me about doing a show and I was standing in catch a rising star on first avenue in 1988 with Larry David and I said so NBC is talking to me about you know that they might want to do something and I can't think of anything to do. So then we go across the street to a Korean deli and we're buying some food to eat some you know junk you know chips and things and we start making fun of everything. And he goes this is what the show should be two comedians just talking. And that's what we started with. ,INTERVIEWER, And did NBCwas it a hit get-go? No. No. Four years. Four years. Really?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes. It had good demographics. In other words we had a good audience that was sort of whatever the advertisers want but we did have very low ratings very low ratings. Very low ratings.,INTERVIEWER, Now you continue now to do your standup? You play Vegas? How many times a year do you go?,INTERVIEWEE, Oh I do about 100 shows a year.,INTERVIEWER, That many?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes. All over the country.,INTERVIEWER, New material?,INTERVIEWEE, Not all the time. As much as I can.,INTERVIEWER, But a lot? You write all your own,INTERVIEWEE, I write all my own stuff. Yes. Do you want to hear a joke?,INTERVIEWER, Yes. Do a joke. Do a joke. Go ahead. Say something funny. A-ha.,INTERVIEWEE, That's the worst setup for a comedian and you know it.,INTERVIEWER, I know that. You can't do that.,INTERVIEWEE, Any guy in a deli knows that you don't tell a comedian be funny.,INTERVIEWER, You got me back in the deli.,INTERVIEWEE, I love you in the deli. I don't know why this is not a deli set. There should be sandwiches here and waiters walking with around. Because that's where you belong in a deli.,INTERVIEWER, This is the world.,INTERVIEWEE, Speaking of food.,INTERVIEWER, I'm going to get to that in a minute.,INTERVIEWEE, Sorry to go out of order. You want to hear a joke? Two peanuts are walking long one was a salted.,INTERVIEWER, "Letters From A Nut" by Ted L. Nancy with an introduction by you.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, Explain this. Is there a guy named Ted Nancy?,INTERVIEWEE, There is a guy but I've never met him.,INTERVIEWER, But he gets big cut of this book.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes. Well I know a guy who knows him and that's where I,INTERVIEWER, You have never met him.,INTERVIEWEE, I have never met.,INTERVIEWER, The hero of this book?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, He wrote all the letters?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, And that was a little falsehood there because in a minute you're going to meet who the real Ted Nancy is with a new edition of "Letters From A Nut." But first another first.,INTERVIEWEE, One of the things that's great about being me,INTERVIEWER, Among many yes.,INTERVIEWEE, Among many is I get to present people that I love that have great talents and great things and I getI use you to do this.,INTERVIEWER, I'm your prop?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, OK.,INTERVIEWEE, I wouldn't say prop. I would say you're my,INTERVIEWER, I'm your idol.,INTERVIEWEE, You're my idol.,INTERVIEWER, OK. ,INTERVIEWEE, If that helps you. So tonight is three people that I'm really here to talk about because I don't talk about myself. Not about me. I know. And this for the first time my wife had a huge hit book.,INTERVIEWER, Unbelievable.,INTERVIEWEE, Two years ago called "Deceptively Delicious." I thought of the title but she did everything else and it was a giant hit and she's finally come out with a sequel. Now I know that your wife loves this book.,INTERVIEWER, Loved it.,INTERVIEWEE, And I know that you drove all around San Francisco trying to find a copy.,INTERVIEWER, The last copy they had.,INTERVIEWEE, I got the first copy of the sequel which has never been seen anywhere before this appearance on larry king LIVE. Here it s "Double Delicious" and it's signed from my wife to your wife Shawn warmest regards Jessica. And that's for you Larry.,INTERVIEWER, Wow. Oh and this book is in stores when?,INTERVIEWEE, I think you can buy it now.,INTERVIEWER, OK. Jessica Seinfeld "Double Delicious" you saw it here first.,INTERVIEWEE, She's not here.,INTERVIEWER, I know.,INTERVIEWEE, She's going to be on Oprah next month.,INTERVIEWER, Oh good.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, I've heard of that show too.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, She goes to Oprah you come to me. I like that.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes. Another one gone. Nobody can hold a job around here.,INTERVIEWER, We're going to do a show together a network in a deli.,INTERVIEWEE, But the most exciting thing tonight go ahead.,INTERVIEWER, All right. That'sall these are nutty letters. Jerry who's with you here?,INTERVIEWEE, Now the man sitting next to me the reason I am bringing him out tonight is because in the 15 years since we have been doing this the internet has started up and a lot of people have been out there taking credit for these letters.,INTERVIEWER, Oh really?,INTERVIEWEE, And saying I wrote the books and they're for sale on my site and because of the internet and you know what that's all about it was time to reveal the mystery. It's his fifth book coming out. Ladies and gentlemen the real author of "Letters From A Nut" is Barry P. Marder sitting next to me who has been a colleague of mine for over 25 years.,INTERVIEWER, Colleague in what way? He writes?,INTERVIEWEE, He's a comedian a comedy writer.,INTERVIEWER, That is from Jerry's show "The Marriage Ref." Madonna Larry David Ricky Gervais what qualified them to give advice? How did you come up with this?,INTERVIEWEE, I just love talking about marriage fights. I find them funny and I love to hear how people respond to other people'sother people's marital issues are comedy for the world.,INTERVIEWER, Not yours?,INTERVIEWEE, Not mine no. And not yours.,INTERVIEWER, No not mine. But theirs.,INTERVIEWEE, Theirs. Anybody else it makes you laugh. So I just thought it would be fun to have a show with funny people coming on and talking about marriage. It seems to provoke natural comedy. I love that show.,INTERVIEWER, When is it on?,INTERVIEWEE, It's coming back on NBC I think the beginning of next year January of next year.,INTERVIEWER, It's not on the early winter right?,INTERVIEWEE, I don't know what they do but they are starting to shoot them now the next season.,INTERVIEWER, Explain television to me.,INTERVIEWEE, It is like,INTERVIEWER, Like "Seinfeld" you lasted four years without being a hit? Couldn't happen today?,INTERVIEWEE, I don't know about that. Don't you believe quality always survives somehow?,INTERVIEWER, You really believe that?,INTERVIEWEE, You busted out laughing at that? Quality survives somehow always. Not always but most of the time. Don't you believe in that? ,INTERVIEWER, A television network would stick with a show havingAnything that's good eventually somehow Finds its way.,INTERVIEWEE, You have to believe in that or you don't go into this business right?,INTERVIEWER, I guess so yeah. It can be disappointing when you have to deal with,INTERVIEWEE, I have never been disappointed fortunately.,INTERVIEWER, You have always had success?,INTERVIEWEE, Always yes.,INTERVIEWER, How do you deal with the suits in the business?,INTERVIEWEE, The suits? The lawsuits or the guys wearing suits?,INTERVIEWER, The guys up at the,INTERVIEWEE, I agree with them. It's like a wife. You agree. You say that makes perfect sense. From now on we are going to do it that way. And then you do whatever you want.,INTERVIEWER, Of course the suits don't watch.,INTERVIEWEE, They don't know. They don't even watch their own network.,INTERVIEWER, So you agree with them. They call you in; you've got a "Seinfeld" episode they didn't like. You tell them OK we will change it.,INTERVIEWEE, When we were doing "Seinfeld" a lot of times they would come in and they would go we don't understand what you are doing. But go ahead. That was the way "Seinfeld" worked.,INTERVIEWER, Why did it work?,INTERVIEWEE, It worked because there was a very loyal powerful audience out there that loved what we did no matterand no matter how crazy it was they stuck with us. And the networks they do watch that and they understand that. So even though they didn't get it they knew the audience got it and the audience liked it. So we were free. And that's the ultimate thing in this business when you're free to do whatever you want. That's the ultimate.,INTERVIEWER, You have attained that now?,INTERVIEWEE, I have. Well obviously. I don't need to be here. I'm here because I'm free to do whatever I want. ,INTERVIEWER, So you actually chose to come here? I choose to come. I am no place that I don't want to be. What time do you wake up? What do you do in the morning? What do you do?,INTERVIEWEE, Do you really want to know? I have three kids.,INTERVIEWER, That's enough.,INTERVIEWEE, They are nine seven and five. If you have three kids it is like having a blender but you don't have the top. You wake up ready. You hit the ground ready. So I wake up and I have breakfast with the kids and we watch Elmo. And people say are you ever going to do another TV series? And I say to them I watch Elmo every morning and he jumps around and he tells jokes or she. I don't even know what the hell this thing is. And I watch Elmo every morning and I think you know what let him bust his little red ass.,INTERVIEWER, Will the public get it though?,INTERVIEWEE, It is a comedy. I know comedy. He is smart.,INTERVIEWER, Does you know Serbian empires?,INTERVIEWEE, No I don't know half of what he is talking about.,INTERVIEWER, Why are we going to laugh?,INTERVIEWEE, Because we present it as a comedy.

No jokes.,INTERVIEWER, Have you done heroic things ever?,INTERVIEWEE, What was this?,INTERVIEWER, This is a heroic thing?,INTERVIEWEE, This is like a medevac. I come onyou're on a show here as a comedian with no audience. That's you know,INTERVIEWER, But there's people here.,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah I guess. But I would say to you what's funny about this show is there's no audience but you can still bomb. You can still go right down in jokes.,INTERVIEWER, When's your next in-person appearance?,INTERVIEWEE, I'm in Memphis tomorrow night Friday.,INTERVIEWER, Memphis.,INTERVIEWEE, Memphis Tennessee. Yes the good people of Memphis.,INTERVIEWER, Theater. Big theater?,INTERVIEWEE, It's a little tiny theater. Of course it's a big theater. It's a huge theater.

So you don't automatically haveyou have them for the firstBob Hope said you have them for the first minute. You get a free minute because if you haveif you're well known. But afternobodyas I like to say nobody laughs at a reputation. If you're funny that night they laugh. If you're not they don't. They want to say I went to see this guy. He bombed. They're dying to tell that story.,INTERVIEWER, How self confident you are.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, We'll be back with our remaining moments with Seinfeld. He's in Memphis. Don't bother they're sold out I'm sure.,INTERVIEWEE, Sold out. Double Delicious October 26th.,INTERVIEWER, Wish we had more time Jer. When we did the scene in the bee movie you pulled up in one of the wildest looking cars.,INTERVIEWEE, Oh really?,INTERVIEWER, You're a car freak.,INTERVIEWEE, I'm a total car nut yes.,INTERVIEWER, How many cars do you own?,INTERVIEWEE, More than I need.,INTERVIEWER, Why? You only need one to get somewhere. Why?,INTERVIEWEE, Because when you're in a car you're inside and you're outside. And you're moving and you're still all at the same time.,INTERVIEWER, You're moving and you're still.,INTERVIEWEE, You're moving and you're still and you're inside and you're outside.,INTERVIEWER, So why do you need four of them or five of them?,INTERVIEWEE, Because II love that experience of,INTERVIEWER, What's your favorite car?,INTERVIEWEE, My favorite car is a Porsche 73 RS that only a Porsche fanatic would know. ,INTERVIEWER, What does it do that other carsIt makes certain sounds. It has a certain feel to it. It's just a hobby. It's an interest. Are you a fast driver?,INTERVIEWEE, No I drive reasonably,INTERVIEWER, You live in the city of New York?,INTERVIEWEE, I live in New York City yes.,INTERVIEWER, You drive around New York City?,INTERVIEWEE, Not around. No I leave. I go outside the city and I drive.,INTERVIEWER, I don't know why that'syou have space to park all these cars?,INTERVIEWEE, I have a little garage I keep my cars. I keep most of the cars someplace else. I'm not telling the thieves where they are.,INTERVIEWER, You lived in L.A. for a while didn't you?,INTERVIEWEE, I lived in L.A. for 18 years from 1980 until the end of the show in 1998. Then I came right back to New York because I believe New York makes you funny. And L.A. makes you less funny.,INTERVIEWER, Why? Why would a city,INTERVIEWEE, Some cities are funny. Do you ever watch the local news in New York and they interview a garbage man? He's always funny right?,INTERVIEWER, That's right. Not funny in L.A.?,INTERVIEWEE, Not funny. Garbage men aren't funny in L.A.,INTERVIEWER, What's another funny city?,INTERVIEWEE, Minneapolis is funny. Miami is funny. Wouldn't you agree? Miami is funny. Tijuana is funny.,INTERVIEWER, Is New Haven funny?,INTERVIEWEE, New Haven is not funny.,INTERVIEWER, Toronto.,INTERVIEWEE, Funny.,INTERVIEWER, Montreal?,INTERVIEWEE, Less funny,INTERVIEWER, You've got to be so hip to get this the band don't get it. Do you have any goals left? You've got a Broadway show books.,INTERVIEWEE, I wasn't kidding you. I love these people I brought on the show tonight Barry Marder Colin Quinn. I love these people. I think they're great talents. And that is my goal that the public should connect with this talent that hasn't quite been discovered yet. So that's my goal for Barry and for Colin.INTERVIEWER, And you will succeed because you're a good guy and you're a funny guy.,INTERVIEWEE, Thank you Larry. And you're a great man. And we thank you for all your years of service.,INTERVIEWER, And thanks for the clock. It shall be here nightly.,INTERVIEWEE, That really makes me feel good.,INTERVIEWER, The cast of "Saturday Night Live" is here tomorrow night.,INTERVIEWEE, Where?,INTERVIEWER, In New York.,INTERVIEWEE, That was my gag in the bee. He's always telling you about some other show. Tomorrow night.,INTERVIEWER,It is a delight to welcome back to larry king LIVEa return visitnow she is the first of the United States Michelle Obama. The last time she waswell you weren't even a candidate. You were,INTERVIEWEE, I wasn't. I was just hanging out and...,INTERVIEWER, How do youdo you like the job?,INTERVIEWEE, I really do. I'm enjoying myself.,INTERVIEWER, It's not paid.,INTERVIEWEE, Itit isn't but it's paid in so many ways other than money. You know II get to do whatyou know we talked about this when I was here before. When you like people having a job where you get to interact with folks on a day-to-day basis and you get to do things that make a differenceand you know I still control my own schedule toto some extent. So it's not a bad gig.,INTERVIEWER, All right. Whatthisthe childhood obesity thing whywhy is this your priority?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes well you know in the first year II focused on a number of things that I will continue to focus onsupport for military spouses; national service which is something I've alreadyalways cared about. But as you know this year I planted this wonderful garden...,INTERVIEWER, Yes.,INTERVIEWEE,the first ever White House garden. And that was to begin the conversation about nutrition. And we engaged local kids in the D.C. area in that effort and got a feel for how they react a more substantive conversation.But on a personal note you know I come to this issue asas a mother. You know before coming to the White House especially when my husband was on the campaign trail we were living the lives of average familiesway too busy rushing...,INTERVIEWER, Fast food.,INTERVIEWEE, Fast food you know deserts too much probably not monitoring TV. I was fortunate enough to have a pediatrician who worked in an urban environment in the African-American community. And he was tracking BMI. And he saw a little up tick in the kids' BMI and he kind of pulled me aside.,INTERVIEWER, BMI means?,INTERVIEWEE, Body mass index which is you know a measure of sort of where people fall onon the weight scale. It's one of the first indicators of...,INTERVIEWER, And it was getting alarming?,INTERVIEWEE, It was getting to the point where he raised a red flag. And he probably was more cautious thanthan most people because of what he had been seeing in his own practice.,INTERVIEWER, How did you react?,INTERVIEWEE, You know I was shocked at first because I didn'tI thought I was doing what I was supposed to do. And I hadn't noticed any changes in mymy kids. So it was a little bit shocking and a little disorienting because II wasn't sure what to do. But I went home and it was kind of a wake-up call. And we made some changes even with busy schedules. And they were minor changes but I thought well we have to do something so.,INTERVIEWER, But did the kids go for it?,INTERVIEWEE, You know they did. And that was the...,INTERVIEWER, They went to broccoli from French fries?,INTERVIEWEE, You know becausewell it was portion sizes. It was a few more cooked meals. You know we had no absolutes except no deserts during the week. Tooktook sugary drinks out of the lunchlunch boxes and put in water and had more milk had more fresh squeezed juices things like that. We talked about processed foods andyou know so they caught on pretty quickly once you know they understood the point of it all. And they became stricter monitors in our household than either me or their father so.,INTERVIEWER, You put the kids in the army.,INTERVIEWEE, Theright. That's right.,INTERVIEWER, How do you reactthere were some who criticize not many but some who criticized you for personalizing itdiscussing it about your children.,INTERVIEWEE, Ithat's the only way I can describe it because that's how I relate to it. And I know that if struggled with it in that way you know a person with means and information and access to you know everything that I needed then what on earth is going on in families and communities around the nation where people don't have the information? So I thoughtI thought it was important to share not just my story but the success. And the point is that small changes made a difference. It wasn't a whole scale upheaval of our lives to see the outcomes.,INTERVIEWER, I don't want to get too statistical at the beginning tonight. We're going to cover other bases.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, But according to a 2007 "New England Journal of Medicine" the number of overweight children ages 6 to 19 has tripled in the last 30 years40 years. Twenty-five million kids are considered obese or overweight. That is a crisis.,INTERVIEWEE, One in three kids. And it's one in two for the African- American and Hispanic community.,INTERVIEWER, Does that lead then to adult diabetes heart trouble?,INTERVIEWEE, Well we're already seeingyou talk to the American Academy of Pediatrics because they're on board with this initiative. And they're seeing high cholesterol in young kids high blood pressure asthma that is preventable...,INTERVIEWER, Asthma?,INTERVIEWEE,and Type 2 Diabetes which is the most sort of troubling because Type 2 Diabetes was only an adult disease and now it'sit's becoming more prevalent among kids. So you know one thing that II try to emphasize is that this isn't about weight and it's not about looks. It's notit's not a physical issue. It's really about the quality of life of our kids. Because you know teachers are seeing you know the challenges that kids with weight issues are havingnot being able to participate in gym feeling a little more sluggish. This is a quality of life issue. And it's not about weight and diet. It's about fitness and it's about overall nutrition that we really have to be emphasizing here.,INTERVIEWER, Do you really think you can make a headway?,INTERVIEWEE, You know...,INTERVIEWER, You've got a task force formed today right?,INTERVIEWEE, Absolutely. The president signed the first ever federal memorandum that establishes a federal task force on childhood obesity. So do I think I can make some inroads?,INTERVIEWER, Yes.,INTERVIEWEE, I think that working with the rest of the country with parents and business leaders and industry leaders and entertainment and sports leagues and parents and doctors and everyone yes I think that we cancan make a difference.,INTERVIEWER, Now how do you handle itkids don't want to be told you're overweight.,INTERVIEWEE, That's right.,INTERVIEWER, Certainly you don't want to say you're fat.,INTERVIEWEE, Right. That's right.,INTERVIEWER, Isn't this is delicate?,INTERVIEWEE, It's an..., INTERVIEWER, This is a delicate balance.,INTERVIEWEE, It's an absoluteIwith my kidsagain all II have is my storyis I never talked about weight. I never discussed what the doctor said. I said you know what we need to change how we eat and let's think of some ways we can do it. So you can have these conversations without having the conversation. And I think it's very important that we don't unintentionally make kids more paranoid or more self-conscious. At the same time I think that it's not useful to point fingers at anyone at kids or parents.,INTERVIEWER, Do you still drop into Burger King or McDonald's?,INTERVIEWEE, We don't do as much fast food but Iwe eat burgers and fries whenwhen...,INTERVIEWER, You can't eliminate it though.,INTERVIEWEE, And you don't have to. I mean that's really the point here. It's really balance. What I tell my kids is if they're eating right you know 70 percent of the time then when they go to a birthday party or it's a Saturday and they're out and you know they can stop for ice cream and somebody wants to grab pizza or they have pancakes with chocolate chips in it it's not a big deal. Because that's how kids live.,INTERVIEWER, Of course.,INTERVIEWEE,and that's how you know theythey wouldn't go for it if it were absolutes. And I think that's one of the messages for parents.,INTERVIEWER, But not daily.,INTERVIEWEE, Notwell notyou know not daily and not every meal every day you know?,INTERVIEWER, We have an iReport question for you...,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, How can a healthy five component lunch be provided for just $0.90 food cost? How can we make children's health a true priority with the funding to back it up?.,INTERVIEWEE, Well that's one of the components of the Let's Move initiative which is the nationwide initiative that we kicked off today. We've got to provide parents with the information and the tools that they need to make better decisions. But we also need to significantly change the quality of food that kids are getting at school because more than 30 million kids get half of their daily calories from the foods that they eat in school. And we don't want to set up a situation where we've got parents doing all the right things at home and then all that stuff gets undone. So the Child Nutrition Reauthorization Act isisis inin line for discussion this year. We're proposing a $10 billion increasethat's $1 billion a year for 10 yearsto really implement this legislation. And we need to focus on the quality of schools in the lunches. I mean it's one thing when you pack your own lunch. But so many families rely on what they're being served in schools that...,INTERVIEWER, You would think schools would be hip to things that...,INTERVIEWEE, Yes. Well and many are. Thethe Department of Agriculture has an initiative called the U.S. Healthy Schools Challenge where it recognizes schools that are already makings these differences. And there...,INTERVIEWER, What do you...,INTERVIEWEE,are hundreds of them. ,INTERVIEWER, I want to touch some other bases then come back to this.,INTERVIEWEE, Sure.,INTERVIEWER, The loss of Ted Kennedy.,INTERVIEWEE, Um-hmm.,INTERVIEWER, You went to the funeral didn't you?,INTERVIEWEE, Oh yes. Yes.,INTERVIEWER, And then the loss of the Senate seat. How has that affected your husband? And do you think this whole question ofof the health bill...,INTERVIEWEE, Well we were all saddened by the loss ofof Senator Kennedy. He was the consummate statesman. He was the grandfather of so much important legislation. And attending the funeral reminded us just the extent of thethe impact that he's had on the lives of all of us not just here in this country but around the world. So it was aa deep loss. But you know wewe have an opportunity to continue that legacy andand we have to.,INTERVIEWER, Do you think you will? Do you think you'll get a health bill?,INTERVIEWEE, I think we don't have a choice. When we look at these statistics we're spending billions of dollars on preventable diseases. And new health care legislation could go a long way to improving prevention first and foremost. Health care reformpeople have to have a pediatrician in order to get good information from their pediatricians. People have to be able to take their kids to well doctor's visits to have all this information tracked. So we have to get this done. And I'm hopeful that Congress will come together that the American people will recognize that doing nothing is absolutely not an option and that we'll fulfill this legacy. So we have to stay vigilant. We need to get something done.,INTERVIEWER, Does he get down easy your husband?,INTERVIEWEE, You know he doesn't get down easily. He gets very focused and very serious when hewhen he's facing a challenge. But you know the thing about Barak is that he stays humble and keeps things in perspective. I mean the challenges that he faces or has faced over this year are not what irk him. It'sit's really you know our inability to solve basic fundamental problems facing the American people.improving the jobless rate getting people back to work ensuring that our kids are getting the absolute best education in the world that prepares them for the future that we have health care that we're really pushing to fix our environment so that we have aa world to live in. When he doesn't get those problems solved that's what irks him.,INTERVIEWER, More with the first lady of the United States. You like hearing that huh?,INTERVIEWEE, It's OK.,INTERVIEWER, OK. It's obvious that we don't have to elaborate. What's your read on the former governor of Alaska?,INTERVIEWEE, You know Iyou know I don't have a read. I mean I try not to make oror set opinions about people that I haven't had any you know substantive interaction with. I mean I know what you see on TV and when you're in the...,INTERVIEWER, Does it irk you when she criticizes what,INTERVIEWEE, You know democracy is about critique and the president is not immune to criticism. I think he's doing a phenomenal job. You know we have to think of where we were when he took office. We were on the brinkthe brink of a depression worse than anyone really ever imagined. And I don't think the country ever really knew how bad things were. And because of some important steps quick thinking smart strategic thinking we're not even talking about that. We've got to do more on jobs. We need to get health care done. There's a lot of work to beto be done. Andand we need to do more to improve the civility in Washington. And I think ifif there's a disappointment Barack wishes that we hadwe'd comeor that we'd come farther in thatin that effort.,INTERVIEWER, Is sheis she a phenomenon to you?,INTERVIEWEE, Again I mean I think sheI think it's wonderful to have strong female voices out there but I don't know her.,INTERVIEWER, What did you think of the Tea Party?,INTERVIEWEE, You know I'mI'm focused on what's in front of me. And right now that's ending childhood obesity in a generationgetting this done. And I think when you're staying focused on solutions trying to bring folks togethergovernors mayors and doctors and educators and athletes together around an issue that has no political party you know has no base in liberalism or conservatism but it's about our kids and making sure they have the best life possible then you know Iit's hard for me...,INTERVIEWER, But you have to think about other things. You read the papers you watch the television. YouI mean you're allyou're very smart and very aware.,INTERVIEWEE, I'm very smart but II try to limit my intake to things that I can control. Because in this position you know it is my responsibility to work with all Americans. And I want to stay focused on the work...,INTERVIEWER, Right.,INTERVIEWEE,rather than you know.,INTERVIEWER, Other things.,INTERVIEWEE, Other things.,INTERVIEWER, Does he counsel with you?,INTERVIEWEE, We talk all the time. I mean we talk as we've done our entire marriage. But it's more everyday talk. It'sit'syou know I try to make our home sort of a stress-free work-free zone for him because it's necessary. When he works above the store it's important tothat when he or I or our kids walk in the door of the residence that there's you know there's a release. So our attention and conversation is still focused mainly around our girls and our family our plans for the future. We do talk about health care. I want to know how his day is going. I'mI'm a citizen concerned about this country too so you know checking thethe temperature is important for me. We talked about this initiative and you know that's one of the reasons why he signed this memorandum because he knows the importance of tackling the childhood obesity...,INTERVIEWER, But you also have to think how does Haiti strike you? What about these 100 Americansthese 10 Americans that may have taken children? We don't know of course what the answer is.,INTERVIEWEE, Right. Right.,INTERVIEWER, Do you expect America to be involved in this?,INTERVIEWEE, Well I think that first of all the crisis in Haiti isyou know it's devastating. For a country that poorfor any country for that matter to experience an earthquake of that magnitude it's going to take decades for them to recover. With regard to kids the kids there I think that you know as the State Department and the U.N. Has said and expert agencies on the ground have said you know we want to make sure that we keep families together. And in a crisis like that kids get separated. Families wind up putting their kids in orphanages with the thought that it's temporary until they can get back on thistheir feet. And one of the things that we don't want to do is unintentionally separate families fromfrom their kids. None of us wants that. So I think you know asas folks here said you know we've got to take it slow get the kids out who we know have homes to go to and make sure that we're very careful about getting the kids who we don't have clear status on out.,INTERVIEWER, Are you satisfied that Haiti will handle this well?,INTERVIEWEE, I think Haiti along with the non-profit organizations on the groundthe folks who you know do thisI think right now the Haitian government needs support fromfrom all sectors. Theretherethere will come a point when they'll get settled and you know things will start building and they'll be able to tackle everything. But right now Haiti needs our help on all these issues.,INTERVIEWER, We're back with Michelle Obama the first lady of the United States. Dodo poll numbers bother you? I mean you're in that interesting influx of yours are up and your husband's are down.,INTERVIEWEE, Um-hmm.,INTERVIEWER, Does that affect dinner?,INTERVIEWEE, No. No. No it doesn't.,INTERVIEWER, That was funny?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes. That was goodit was a good one. No I mean it'sit's you know when you've been on this path in a campaign I mean you see how poll numbers they go up they go down. And sometimes you can pinpoint why sometimes you can't. I amI'mI'm very flattered that the American people today feel like I'm doing a very good job in representing them. And my husband is proud of that as well. So it doesn't cause any tension at the dinner table.,INTERVIEWER, Just looking at him and observing him over these few years does he ever get mad mad?,INTERVIEWEE, Oh yes.,INTERVIEWER, Angry angry?,INTERVIEWEE, Oh absolutely. But...,INTERVIEWER, Ticked off?,INTERVIEWEE, Oh yes. Yes he's human. You know if you prick him he'll bleed.,INTERVIEWER, He never shows it.,INTERVIEWEE, You know I think that his view of mainmaintaining a constructive approachyou know he's always about finding the solution. And he knows if you go too far emotionally if you get too angry or youif you become too complacent sometimes you miss the answer in between. And that's I think one of the strengths of him as a leader. You know wewe talked about wanting a stable consistent leader. We have that in him. That doesn't mean he doesn't show emotion. It's just that he shows it at appropriate times. He'll come home. He'll talk to his cabinet. He'll you know he'll converse with his advisers. There are appropriate times to show anger and frustration. But the American people don't care about the president's anger or frustration. They want tothey want to know he's solving some problems.,INTERVIEWER, We know how important fatherhood is to him motherhood is to you. I remember him telling me taking the kids to school was a big priority to him.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, He hated campaigning when he had to be away from it. He can't take them to school now right?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes well it's a big old hassle.,INTERVIEWER, So raising kids in the White House is hard right?,INTERVIEWEE, It's different. But it's easier in so many ways...,INTERVIEWER, How does he deal with that?,INTERVIEWEE, Well you know there are some things he can't do but there are many things he can do. He gets up every morning. He sees his kids before they leavenot something he did two years ago could do two three years ago. He comes home at a certain time. He can have dinner. He can read to the kids at night tuck them into bed. We have much more quality time. We can't go out necessarily but he still goes to the parent-teacher conferences. He still goes to the...,INTERVIEWER, He goes to the school?,INTERVIEWEE, Oh absolutely. He goes to every performance and play. He goes to basketball games and soccer games. He can't go to every single one of them because someon Saturdays oftentimes he's working. But you know he is as involved as he has been it's just for example he can't take the kids to school every day. Quite frankly they don't want him to. They think his motorcade is a complete embarrassment.,INTERVIEWER, What's it like for them growing up? That'sone of the Roosevelt kids told me years ago that it'sit's at best it's strange to grow up in that house.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes. It is. But you know I think you know what you know. And you know I'll be interested to see what they say when they're 20 and 30. But right now theythey take it in stride. I mean the White House is a strange place to live but it's surprisingly pleasant because the people who work there really care about every single family that comes through. They're good with kids and they try to adapt to their idiosyncrasies and create a sense of normalcy. So that's what they feel. It's like living in a big hotel with a whole bunch of fun people that you can work with. But then whenwhen the doors close it'sit's like home.,INTERVIEWER, Do they have play dates?,INTERVIEWEE, They have play dates. They just...,INTERVIEWER, Kids come over?,INTERVIEWEE, A friend just left the house because it's a snow day. We're all snowed in so they're getting stir crazy and driving us nuts. Had kidssome friends sleep over the night before last. They go over to other kid's homes. They do...,INTERVIEWER, They do that that's a problem for the Secret Service isn't it when they go to other people's ,INTERVIEWEE, The Secret Service is very accommodating. And we don'ttry not to talk too much about what they do but you know the kids do ,INTERVIEWER, But you tell them they're going over to Henry's house?,INTERVIEWEE, The kids lead normal lives. And it's because of the Secret Service that they can.,INTERVIEWER, Good for you.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, We're back with Michelle Obama. By the way tomorrow night the vice president of the United States Joe Biden will be here. And still to come some moments tonight with Bill Cosby. Not bad so far.,INTERVIEWEE, One of my favorite favorite people.,INTERVIEWER, Both of them right?,INTERVIEWEE, Oh absolutely. The ,INTERVIEWER, Don't leave Jo out.,INTERVIEWEE, Jo and Bill absolutely.,INTERVIEWER, All right probably the biggest single problemhyphenated with health careis jobs right?,INTERVIEWEE, Um-hmm.,INTERVIEWER, You mentioned it briefly. There's so many people out of work. His critics say your husband should be doing more he promised more.,INTERVIEWEE, Um-hmm.,INTERVIEWER, How do you react?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes. Until the unemployment numbers go down I don't think my husband is satisfied. And more isis coming. You know a lot was saved with the stimulus. And again you know it'sit's hard to tell people who are hurting that things could have been worse if we hadn't done what we've done. So you know there's no point in pointing back. There's a lot more to be done and he's not going to be satisfied and he'suntil he sees those unemployment figures go down.,INTERVIEWER, How is theit was so bitterwell rather bitter in the campaign with Hillary when they were going at each other.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes it seems so long ago.,INTERVIEWER, Yes. How are they doing now together?,INTERVIEWEE, They're great. Hillary Clinton is an amazing secretary of State. I mean she would have been an amazing president. She was an amazing attorney. She's a phenomenal professional. And she's proven to be a tremendous asset inin so many ways. So the relationship isisis strong. They share the same views in terms of international policy and approach. And we're seeing the outcome of that on the international stage. I think you know we can say pretty clearly that the United Statesthethe view of this nation around the world has changed. People are enthusiastic about the potential. Things aren't perfect. We're still a nation fighting two wars. But when we travel around the country the excitement and the possibility are palpable. And I think that's because of the president but I think it's also because of our secretary of State.,INTERVIEWER, How tough is it for you when a man or a woman is lost in battle?,INTERVIEWEE, Oh it's the hardest thing. You know I think one of the hardest things that the president said he had to do this year was to greet the caskets of fallen soldiers that evening to you know sit down with parents who have buried their child. When we went to Fort Hood you know meeting with the families ,INTERVIEWER, Oh.,INTERVIEWEE,of the survivors ofof that tragedy I mean you know ,INTERVIEWER, How do you train for that?,INTERVIEWEE, You don't you know? What helps me is that II see how strong they are. You know just how ,INTERVIEWER, They help you?,INTERVIEWEE, They help me. That'syou know that's one of thethe reasons why the issue of military families is so important to me. Maybe it's selfish because they give me strength. You know and the same thing is true for the president. When we look around and you think of the minor irritations that go along with being the president you think about the real sacrifice ofof our troops and you want to make sure that they have the resources they need when they're in the battlefield and that they have the resources and support when they come home and that their families are well taken care of. And we have to work hard for that. That's you know that's not just a given.,INTERVIEWER, Some more moments with the first lady her highnessah Well we got rid of that years ago right?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes. Yes.,INTERVIEWER, We're back with Michelle Obama. Fighting obesityhow about the image problem of children?,INTERVIEWEE, Um-hmm.,INTERVIEWER, They have a certain self-image. This could hurt them to hear things like this couldn't it? Again we've discussed delicate balance.,INTERVIEWEE, Right. Right. And I get,INTERVIEWER, We tread water here.,INTERVIEWEE, Well youand you have to continue to tread water. Approaching this we have to look at it from a whole range ofof pillars as weinformation to parents improving school lunches improving accessibility and affordability which means eliminating food deserts. Areas in this country where there are no supermarkets so that families do have access to food. And then the last important pillar is really physical education. And that seems to be one of the more important ones for me. Because if kids are able to raise their level of activity it frees them up to not have to worry about you know every little thing that they eat because their activity level tends to be that of a normal kid. The president's fitness challenge is going to play an important role really modernizing that challenge to make sure that it just doesn't focus on athleticism. Which it has in the pasthow many push ups or sit ups you can do. And not every kid is an athlete. But you don't have to be an athlete to be physically fit. You just have to move.,INTERVIEWER, What are you asking Joe and Martha Citizen to do? ,INTERVIEWEE, Well ,INTERVIEWER, A couple is watching tonight. They got two kids at home. What do you ask them to do?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes. I'm sayfirst of all be cognizant. You know be honest. Look around and say you know "Are things where they should be?" You know? Are my kids good? Are they getting the level of physical activity? Are they eating right? Do they have the energy level? If the answers are no talk to your pediatrician. Get a real assessment of what's going on. And then work with them to structure some solutions. And they can be pretty small you know? I'd say turn off the T.V. Eat dinner together as a family. There was a study that showed that structure in children's lives whether they're eating meals as a family on a regular basis they have a regular bed timeall that structure really decreases thethe likelihood that a child will be obese.,INTERVIEWER, You can make changes.,INTERVIEWEE, Cut down portion sizes. And even if you're not in a safe neighborhood find ways to be more active with your kids. And it could be turning on the radio and dancing until you sweat for a half an hour. If you live on the top floor walk up and down the stairs. Walk to school if you can.,INTERVIEWER, Yes.,INTERVIEWEE, Find those small ways as a family to ,INTERVIEWER, Simple.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes. You know and that's what I would tell the average viewersimple.,INTERVIEWER, Yes.,INTERVIEWEE, You know it's not a whole scale change. Small changes.,INTERVIEWER,go to quick things.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, Just a few days till Valentines.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, What do you expect? Roses? Chocolates?,INTERVIEWEE, Oh I expect the moon the stars and the sun honey.,INTERVIEWER, What do you usually get?,INTERVIEWEE, I usually get dinner and a gift of some sort.,INTERVIEWER, Then you're going to go out for Valentines?,INTERVIEWEE, I don't know.,INTERVIEWER, It's a Sunday.,INTERVIEWEE, I don't know. Because we might be traveling. We might spend some time at Camp David. So ifbut I'm not sure yet. We haven't finalized the plans.,INTERVIEWER, Does he get a gift federally?,INTERVIEWEE, A nice card.,INTERVIEWER, Thanks.,INTERVIEWEE, Thank you.,INTERVIEWER, Tonight Jimmy Fallon. The late night laugh man is turning primetime Emmy host. He wants your help. We'll find out why. And then his take on the new cast of "Dancing with the Stars" his old stomping ground "Saturday Night Live." Plus Jay versus Dave versus Conan. What's it like to play beer pong with Betty White?

He's host of the double-award Emmy winning "Late Night with Jimmy Fallon." He's hosting the 62nd annual primetime Emmy Awards this Sunday night on NBC.,INTERVIEWEE, By the way don't make that be confusing because it's not the 60 second annual primetimeit's longer than 60 seconds. I don't want people thinking that it's 60 seconds only,INTERVIEWER, I meant the annual I meant the show is 62nd years.,INTERVIEWEE, It's longer than 60 seconds.,INTERVIEWER, Okay.,INTERVIEWEE, A lot of people have been asking me about that. It will be longer than a minute.,INTERVIEWER, And I have in front of me an Emmy I won.,INTERVIEWEE, Hey.,INTERVIEWER, Yes. So I thought it would be appropriate that we display this in your honor.,INTERVIEWEE, That's a beautiful award.,INTERVIEWER, Yes well you have gotten them.,INTERVIEWEE, You have probably many awards. Yes I just got one recently but I think they mail them to you. I haven't got mine Fed Ex'd to me yet. But that's a beautiful,INTERVIEWER, How did they ask you to host this? How'd that come about? ,INTERVIEWEE, Well it's on NBC this year. So I think they run down their NBC list of like whoso I was right under "The Biggest Loser." And then it was me. And they go"Biggest Loser" said no. And I said yeah absolutely. But I did the Emmys last year actually. Neil Patrick Harris did a great job hosting. And I did,INTERVIEWER, You were a presenter?,INTERVIEWEE, I was a presenter. And I did some bit where I came out with auto tune mike. So he sounded like it was rapper T-Pain. So I came on and I was like party everybody ready to party. And I slipped and I fell and I pretended to hurt my back. And then I was just screaming in pain but auto tuned. So it was likehelp me. And so I did that for a while. And then I said just roll the clip. Roll the clip. And then so asked me they said would you want to host? Maybe think about it for next year.,INTERVIEWER, I mean who in your family knocked the crib over?,INTERVIEWEE, Hey we didn't have a crib. I was raised by wolves.,INTERVIEWER, A take-off on the "Mad Men." Funny funny.,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah yeah.,INTERVIEWER, The preparation for this kind of show what do you have to go through? Like you're on tape all this week right?,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah. I'm on repeats all this week in New York. So I'm out in L.A. I got a tan. Well this is what I call a tan. This is pretty good for an Irishman. I burn first. And then it takesthe burn goes away and they turn like a cinnamon colored but I come out here. As soon as I heard that I was hosting we started writing. I worked with my writers on "Late Night." And we came up with like 200 great ideas. And then you know honestly probably 50 ideas. And then the producer we gave it to the producer. He goes these are all great. Tom (INAUDIBLE) is a great producer. He goes these are all great. He goes but we do have to give out awards at sometime. So we can't dothis is too many bits. We can't. So we whittled it down. We have a really good opening a strong opening I think. And then,INTERVIEWER, That's the key to those shows that opening though?,INTERVIEWEE, It is right.,INTERVIEWER, You got to grab them.,INTERVIEWEE, You got to have a good opening.,INTERVIEWER, Can you give us a hint?,INTERVIEWEE, I can't give you a hint. It's,INTERVIEWER, Just a hint.,INTERVIEWEE, a lot of celebrities are helping me in the opening.,INTERVIEWER, Oh. They've rehearsed it and all with you?,INTERVIEWEE, Uh-huh uh-huh.,INTERVIEWER, Are they going to tape the opening or you do it live?,INTERVIEWEE, You asked for one hint Larry.,INTERVIEWER, Okay.,INTERVIEWEE, This is sane. This is getting ridiculous.,INTERVIEWER, You're having a Twitter contest regarding the Emmys. Explain it for our fans.,INTERVIEWEE, Okay. So what we're going to do. What you're going to do is you're watching the Emmys. And you have your computer your laptop next to you your mobile phone. You look at the presenters that are on that list. And you go Jon Hamm. And you go my grandma should leave my grandpa for Jon Hamm. And you Tweet that out. And then I get it. And I select from the differentall amounts of Tweets. And I could use your tweets to intro a presenter Jon Hamm on the Emmys. So and you could type out any intro you want as many times as you want.,INTERVIEWER, Do I get something if you use my Twit?,INTERVIEWEE, Fame.,INTERVIEWER, Your name?,INTERVIEWEE, Fame yes.,INTERVIEWER, Fame?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes your name is on the Emmys. And your Twitter address. So you'll probably get followers. I guarantee at least five followers. Yeah.,INTERVIEWER, This bizarrebut this is modernthis is social media right? ,INTERVIEWEE, I figured this isyes I mean thisyou couldn't do this last year. I figure this is just somethingwho knows if it'll work? It might now work but it's something different. And it's something to keep you watching the Emmys. You're like well why not? I'm here. I got my phone with me. I might as well try it.,INTERVIEWER, This is only Thursday but being honest are you nervous?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes a little nervous.,INTERVIEWER, It's a big platform.,INTERVIEWEE, I've thrown up a couple of times. More for weight loss but you know you know because you lose weight faster if you throw up your food.,INTERVIEWER, And you know the critics watch this and on Monday morning you get reviewed..,INTERVIEWEE, Yes I know that. And it's usually the reviews are never that good. They never,INTERVIEWER, They don't laugh. Critics don't laugh.,INTERVIEWEE, They yes. So I'm not really looking for good critics. I was thinking about that because Neil Patrick Harris did pretty well last year. So I was going to do what he did word for word. I figured if I do half as good as he did I'll be happy.,INTERVIEWER, You won a couple Emmys this week right?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, Oh yes,INTERVIEWEE, Who won?,INTERVIEWER, You won this week on the,INTERVIEWEE, Oh I did? I won one for editing because we do these pretapes. We spoof "Real Housewives." We spoofed "Lost." We did a series called "Late" where an elevator crashes on the floor and we didn't know how to get off. We have no budget on our show Larry. You have to understand. We have to use an abandoned floor at NBC. And we made it work. So we got nominated yes. And so we won for a "Glee" spoof we did called "6-B" because that's where our studio is. And so like we did like a sing thing a song thing. And it was really funny. And then we also won for best website. Latenightwithjimmyfallon.com.,INTERVIEWER, Website is now an Emmy?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes of course. What are you talking about? It's always been.,INTERVIEWER, When , INTERVIEWEE, I don'tno I mean I don't know if it's a newI'll take it. It's an Emmy.,INTERVIEWER, Did you jump up and shriek with glory and glee?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes I cried yes I cried. And that's just what happens in my bedroom every night. I justI have problems. I got to take an Ambien or something because it's justthese nightmares I have are just awful. I could get into detail with you but it would justit would blow your mind.,INTERVIEWER, Do you want to keep doing this late night thing forever? Do you have a goal beyond this like,INTERVIEWEE, Good question.,INTERVIEWER, Leno out you in?,INTERVIEWEE, No. Well I'm happy where I am. At 12:30 it's like if you get you know the viewers the ratings they're happy. The network's happy. I'm happy. So so far so good. So I'm really happy,INTERVIEWER, You don't look beyond it?,INTERVIEWEE, No. I said this on the show and the whole late night thing went down I said the one thing I've learned from hosting late night from David Letterman and from Conan O'Brien is that it's a one way ticket to not hosting "The Tonight Show". If you want to not host "The Tonight Show" host late night for a couple of years. See what happens.,INTERVIEWER, That's right. You're doomed.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes exactly. Yes so maybe I'll get into like the perfume business.,INTERVIEWER, Now there's a rumor spreading here that younow you're a big shot host.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, Are you thinking of getting this job? And want to check this out were you sitting in this chair earlier?,INTERVIEWEE, Was I sitting in that chair?,INTERVIEWER, Yes did you sit in this chair my chair?,INTERVIEWEE, I don'tI don't think so. I mean I don't know what you're talking about?,INTERVIEWER, No are you denying it?,INTERVIEWEE, I don't know what you're getting at Larry.,INTERVIEWER, Were you comfortable in this chair?,INTERVIEWEE, It was a very comfortable chair actually. It really is.,INTERVIEWER, It is nice isn't it?,INTERVIEWEE, It's worked in yes. Has that been here for the whole time?,INTERVIEWER, Well you lied to me though.,INTERVIEWEE, Now it's turning into the godfather. Are you going to put an orange peel in your mouth and,INTERVIEWER, You have relatives in New Jersey? Jimmy got his start on "Saturday Night Live." We'll take a look at some of his greatest moments and ask what he thinks of that show now and what's ahead for that show. And we'll talk of course about late night wars. Don't go away. Okay. Jimmy Fallon he hosts "Late Night." Now you've got your show.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, Because Conan was replacing Jay.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, So they need someone at 12:30.,INTERVIEWEE, That's right.,INTERVIEWER, And then do you feel any guilt that you suddenly have a show that Conan didn't have until he signed with TBS and Conan mentioned you that he wouldn't quit because they were going tohe wouldn't stay because they were going to move you to 1:00 a.m.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, So you changed the face of late-night television. Do you think about that? Think about it.,INTERVIEWEE, You put it that way I'm thinking about it yes.,INTERVIEWER, You!,INTERVIEWEE, Yes thank you yes. I got it. Yes. Iyou know what?,INTERVIEWER, We're live now Jimmy.,INTERVIEWEE, I actually got thisI know well when I got thiswhen I got "Late Night" everything was fine. I was doing "Late Night" it's good. Conan was there. And Jay wasJay we didn't know what Jay was up to.,INTERVIEWER, Somewhere at 10:00. ,INTERVIEWEE, Yes Jay ended up at 10:00 but we didn't know what he was going to do at 10:00. Then he 10:00. And then it became like the biggest story in the business. And I'm just sitting there like I just got here. Like I don't knowand I got here at the most exciting time in late night. And I'm friends with Jay. And I'm friends with Conan. And I'm friends with Dave. I mean I'm friends with all those guys because as an actor you go on all the shows. So I know all of them. So I was like I'm just going to keep doing my job and keep my head down and just try to make people laugh.,INTERVIEWER, What did you make of the wars?,INTERVIEWEE, You know it's tricky. It's difficult stuff. And you go like I don't knowI don't know what the real story is. I don't know what they've dealt with but I know that it'sit was crazy.,INTERVIEWER, What was NBC thinking your network,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, about a 10:00 script show?,INTERVIEWEE, Another talk show. Well I thought you do Jay Leno's talk show. Then you do the news. Then you do Conan's talk show. And I think at that point everyone in America's just ready for one more talk show.,INTERVIEWER, That was the thinking.,INTERVIEWEE, Yesthatthey're just primed up. Like let's go. More talk. This is fantastic.,INTERVIEWER, All right how do you think Conan's going to do at 11:00 on TBS?.,INTERVIEWEE, I think TBSTBS is very lucky to have Conan O'Brien I think. I think he's a funny funny guy. I know him. He's great. So I think it'she's going to change the face of their late night structure absolutely because,INTERVIEWER, You ever get to see Craig Ferguson?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes I talked to him on the phone.,INTERVIEWER, You do?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, He's a funny guy too.,INTERVIEWEE, He's a really funny guy. He's a charming guy a smart guy.

I go yes no late-night wars. But he was actually really funny. And he did a thing where he waved to me onfrom his show with the big Mickey Mouse hand. He goes no late-night wars. And he goes if you don't want me to wave back. And I was likeso we got a Mickey Mouse hand. And I waved back across the country there. Just being buddies. And I've talked to him since.,INTERVIEWER, You got this whole gig. You came to comic "Saturday Night Live.",INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, Did youwere you comfortable in the fact of hosting a show interviewing people doing bits?,INTERVIEWEE, Not at first. It's not easy. It's tricky. I mean I got used to it. I mean when I first started I didn't have the air conditioning where it should be in my studio. I was sweating flops sweat (INAUDIBLE) Deniro cross-eyed. Like so what are you like raging bull? You're in a movie? How's the movie? What's a movie? Go to commercial. Like what's a movie? Like he was confused. And now I'm much better.,INTERVIEWER, You're comfortable?,INTERVIEWEE, I used to worry about time. Do we have enough time? We got to go to commercial? Now I don't care. It's like let's just talk. Because I would talk and the conversation would get good and they go we got to go to commercial. It's like what are you doing? Shut up and let them talk.,INTERVIEWER, Secret is the world ain't going to change. Right?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes sir that's good.,INTERVIEWER, It ain't brain surgery.,INTERVIEWEE, I love this. Well I'm going towe're going to miss you when you go eventually.,INTERVIEWER, I'll be around.,INTERVIEWEE, Now you're going to be around longer I heard. Rumors are around you're staying longer. You're doing a show with Kate Gosselin? It's going to be amazing.,INTERVIEWER, He'll never be back. We'll be back with Jimmy Fallon.,INTERVIEWEE, Fallon that's what it was., Maybe I'll sniff it.,INTERVIEWER, Is she a hoot?,INTERVIEWEE, Man what a great person.,INTERVIEWER, Great guest. And her career is alive again.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes yes I just,INTERVIEWER, Because of Snickers.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes exactly. That's what it was. It was a Snickers commercial.,INTERVIEWER, Superbowl commercial.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes she's coming the Emmys. And just,INTERVIEWER, What's she going to do? Is she going to do a thing on the show?,INTERVIEWEE, Dear Lord I just hope she's not drunk. I just pray,INTERVIEWER, Could be it's late afternoon.,INTERVIEWEE, it's just tough. It is just tough. Itgetting her in the limo. And that is the hardest part you know? We can prop her up in the chair you know?,INTERVIEWER, But you're going to be on the show?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes almost like a "Weekend at Bernie's" thing. We're attaching the strings to her arms. We're going to clap and stuff like that.,INTERVIEWER, Well let's hope she lives. Okay? All right. How did youhow did you get "Saturday Night Live"? What were you doing at the time?,INTERVIEWEE, I was doing stand-up comedy out in Los Angeles out here. I got my start at the "Improv" on Melrose Bud Friedman (ph). When I was in New York I grew up in upstate New York. Socrates New York. My mom ,INTERVIEWER, Socrates?,INTERVIEWEE, Socrates no Socrates that was my nickname.,INTERVIEWER, Okay.,INTERVIEWEE, Socrates New York. It's by Woodstock Poughkeepsie. And my mom heard about an impression contest on the radio. And so she told me she goes you're doing voices up in your room. And so why don't you you know go after this contest? And I went out. It was at Bananas Comedy Club and I won first place. And I think it was like $500. I was 16 years old. And I was like $500 for one minute of comedy? This is my career.mINTERVIEWER, That's a good gig.,INTERVIEWEE, This is a good gig.,INTERVIEWER, How did you get "Saturday Night Live"?,INTERVIEWEE, So I went out to L.A. I did Groundlings. And I justI took acting lessons. And I got an audition for the show. I went and performed in front of Lorne Michaels.,INTERVIEWER, Just him sitting there?,INTERVIEWEE, It's a dark room.,INTERVIEWER, What did they have you do?,INTERVIEWEE, They have you do impressions and the original characters and if you do any music do musical impressions. And I was an impressionist. I just wanted to do just different characters and voices. And everyone tells you Lorne's not going to laugh. He won't laugh. So the guy's putting the microphone on and he's like hey good luck dude. Lorne's not going to laugh. What do you mean? He goes Mr. Michaels (INAUDIBE) so don't worry about it. If he doesn't laugh justit's like okay no problem. So then I go into the make-up room. And the girl's like oh you look great but Lorne's not going to laugh. Just know that he doesn't laugh. He's seen it all. And so I go okay okay that's great. And then I go into wardrobe. And he was like here you go. You look great. And Lorne doesn't like toI go no he doesn't like to laugh. I heard you. What is this guy's problem? So anyways I go out. And I do this. I'm so scared. Everyone tells me he's not going to laugh. And I do impressions. And at one point I do Adam Sandler. And he starts laughing. And he puts his head in his hand. And he starts laughing. No one had done Adam Sandler. And I was like wow. It was my moment. I go this is just the coolest thing.,INTERVIEWER, Hire you right there?,INTERVIEWEE, No but I just felt it right there. I'm like that's like my "Wonder Years" moment.,INTERVIEWER, Well how did they get,INTERVIEWEE, No they makes you wait for like three months. This is true. They make you wait. Your agent is calling every day. You don't hear anything. I'm like I didn't get it. I'm a loser. This is over. You know my career's done. You know I don't know what to do. I was going to have eight babies with somebody and start a reality show. I didn't know what was going to happen. So then what I washe calls and I met him. And I was in California out in Paramount Studios. And I met him in a room that was all white. It was very heavenly. It's like cream colored and white. It was like a Calvin Klein obsession ad. And the wind was blowing. And he had his shirt off. No just kidding. But he was sitting there. And he had his feet up. And he goes do you wear wigs? This is the first question. I was like oh I do this to my hair. He goes no no. I'm asking if you've ever done characters and wore wigs he goes because we want you for the show.,INTERVIEWER, Wow.,INTERVIEWEE, And then everything was in slow motion.,INTERVIEWER, Let's take a look at some of Jimmy's greatest "Saturday Night Live" hits. Watch. What a lot of fun that was.,INTERVIEWEE, It was the best job in the whole wide world.,INTERVIEWER, I'll bet.,INTERVIEWEE, It was the greatest and all the history there. And,INTERVIEWER, How many years were you on?,INTERVIEWEE, Six seasons. So I think it was almost seven.,INTERVIEWER, WhatI hear Will Forte's not returning next year?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes it's a bummer.,INTERVIEWER, So you became a star. A lot of stars came from that show.,INTERVIEWEE, I leftI wanted to do what Belushi did. He was in three years and left. But it justthings don't work like that anymore. Like do you know Chevy Chase was only on one season?,INTERVIEWER, What? Who?,INTERVIEWEE, He was only on for one season Chevy Chase.,INTERVIEWER, One year?,INTERVIEWEE, That's it.,INTERVIEWER, Falling down.,INTERVIEWEE, Falling down. That's it. Big star movie star. I mean but everyone thinks Chevy Chase must have been on for ten seasons.,INTERVIEWER, What do you make of the show now?,INTERVIEWEE, It's great. It's the best show on television besides "larry king LIVE.",INTERVIEWER, Because?,INTERVIEWEE, Because it's live. It's live and to do all that,INTERVIEWER, Risk taking?,INTERVIEWEE, It's all that work the hard work. Just the lighting is hard work. The makeup the hair the costume changes. I mean do you know how many times we spoof "larry king LIVE" on the show? It's not easy to build the little dots behind here.,INTERVIEWER, One night you came on you know you breathe cold. You don't say anything. It's just coldthe first bit is always cold.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, And I'm watching. I was at Disneyworld for an award show. I was a presenter to Ted Turner. He was going on television hall of fame. And it was Saturday night. And I turned on TV. And I see my set and Iand the first thing I said was they're running a tape.,INTERVIEWEE, You thought did I do that?,INTERVIEWER, Yes.,INTERVIEWEE, When did I do that?,INTERVIEWER, They do great things.,INTERVIEWEE, They do great work. And it's like live every week. And it's like what people don't know going to commercial break you know you're at home watching a commercial but they're running around. There's people under the bleachers.,INTERVIEWER, Now they show them running around.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, Then they do awhere they show,INTERVIEWEE, A quick little bumper.,INTERVIEWER, Yes.,INTERVIEWEE, It's magical show. And Lorne Michaels is brilliant and all the people that work there brilliant.,INTERVIEWER, Jimmy's imitated some of the biggest names out there. Seinfeld Cosby and as you saw earlier even me. We'll get a sampling of some of his voices next. He's hosting the Emmys. We're back. What happened there?,INTERVIEWEE, Well you know what it is? I'm wearing a hearta heart thing.,INTERVIEWER, Oh.,INTERVIEWEE, So if I get too close to a microwave or a clip of my show things go screwy.,INTERVIEWER, I'm a huge huge fan of yours.,INTERVIEWEE, Thanks.,INTERVIEWER, What I wanted to know is how hard is it to try to keep a straight face when you're working with these people that are obviously so talented?,INTERVIEWEE, I have the worst time at that. Thank you for asking. I really break up in sketches. I'm very unprofessional actor. But I've worked withwe did a sketch calledI think it was calledeveryone calls it Cow Bell now or I Need More Cow Bell. It was with Will Farrell and he was a cow bell player in the band. And he played it so loud that the band couldn't hear any of the instruments. They have the amplifiers and he's hitting this cow bell really loud. And then the producer comes in Christopher Walkenhe would come in and go "what was wrong with that take? It was great." He goes "I got to have more cow bell though." You know? So he kept doing this. Will Farrell's like that's what I'm trying to say. That's what I'm saying. We have to have more. And so he did this bit dress rehearsal and then on air he came on with a smaller shirt. And so when he lifted the cow bell his gut came out the bottom. I couldn'tthen the glasses fell off at one point. He was running around kicking things.,INTERVIEWER, You had to laugh.,INTERVIEWEE, I couldn'tit was looking in the eyes of a lunatic. He's the funniest man on Earth. It was fantastic.,INTERVIEWER, Did you see the other guys? Three times I saw it. You can't stop laughing.,INTERVIEWEE,when they had the silent fight at the funeral? They're whispering fighting like I'm going to kill you. They start fighting each other but quietly.,INTERVIEWER, Bed Bath and Beyond.,INTERVIEWEE, Oh my gosh. Great.,INTERVIEWER, Mark Wahlberg.,INTERVIEWEE, He was fantastic. Michael Keaton they got his back.,INTERVIEWER, Hey Jimmy. Who's your favorite person you ever worked with on "Saturday Night Live"?,INTERVIEWEE, I probably would say Lorne Michaels as far as people.,INTERVIEWER, I guess she means in skits.,INTERVIEWEE, I'd say they're all good. They're all cast members. But me and Tina Fey had a good ride.,INTERVIEWER, She's doing OK.,INTERVIEWEE, What is she up to?,INTERVIEWER, What is she doing?,INTERVIEWEE, I think she's doing a show with Kate Gosselin.,INTERVIEWER, Do you have a fixation on Kate Gosselin? Do you have something for Kate Gosselin? You've mentioned her three times already.,INTERVIEWEE, Look I'm just saying if this show doesn't work out for me Kate I can dance. I can be a dancing partner. I have seen you dance.,INTERVIEWER, I know you can dance.,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah.,INTERVIEWER, OK. Let's do some imitations all right? We don't have to go long.,INTERVIEWEE, Do you do imitations?,INTERVIEWER, No I just do me.,INTERVIEWEE, You do a pretty good you by the way.,INTERVIEWER, Jerry Seinfeld.,INTERVIEWEE, OK people what is this place? What kind of countries are these colors different colored dots?,INTERVIEWER, Cosby.,INTERVIEWEE, You know the people they come on Larry King with the lip and ,INTERVIEWER, Chris Rock!,INTERVIEWEE, larry king LIVE. larry king LIVE. larry king LIVE.,INTERVIEWER, Robin Williams.,INTERVIEWEE, Oh it's a beautiful thing yes thank you. The kids at home going (INAUDIBLE)where's Larry? What's up? Kick and chain and hello. Hi. Oh yes. Thank you.,INTERVIEWER, You know the thing about Robin Williams? You can never remember anything he did. You try to repeat the next day Robin Williams' jokes. ,INTERVIEWEE, It's just 100 of them.,INTERVIEWER, I know. Let's do one more Adam Sandler the one you did.,INTERVIEWEE, OK. He has like three levels Adam Sandler. He does the mumbling Adam where he's like hi how you doing Larry. Good to see you buddy.

Maybe there's a fight.,INTERVIEWER, That's in the other room.,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah in the bar. My dad would do like James Cagney and stuff like that.

My dad had the No Respect album. They were very Irish Catholic raised kids. My dad would take a key and scratch out the curse words on the album so it would skip over the curse words. so I'd miss half the joke. I tell you the guy walked in and he wasmy wife saidand then he saidand you go OK this isI'm not getting this joke.,INTERVIEWER, Is there any famous performer that you couldn't catch?

I did like interviewing Robert Deniro.,INTERVIEWER, You liked him?,INTERVIEWEE, I loved him.,INTERVIEWER, He's a tough guest.,INTERVIEWEE, He had nothing to promote. He came on because he's a New Yorker and he likes me. And that meant the world to me. And thatwhen you are starting a show it's not easy to book guests. The fact that he did that was likeI love him.,INTERVIEWER, Tough to draw out though right?,INTERVIEWEE, One-word answers.,INTERVIEWER, I know. How do you do Deniro?,INTERVIEWEE, Nope. Yep. I don't know. What? I don't even take huh? That was a goodyou know the question is good when he asks you to repeat it. My mom saidshe's deaf in one ear.

Letterman has all the mothers famous mothers on the show to do the top ten lists. Every mother comes out and does a joke. It's like Beyonce's mother Lance Armstrong's mother. So my mom comes out and her joke was like "stay away from that Paris Hilton" or something. It was a funny joke. And then she went back in line with all the other mothers. So Letterman is going by and he's giving a rose to all the mother that came on the show. Here you go. Thanks for coming on. Thanks for coming on. He goes up to my mother thanks for coming on.

If George Clooney and Brad Pitt can't do it ,INTERVIEWER, One or the other. Clooney has darker hair.,INTERVIEWEE, He got darker. We can dye his hair any color.

Betty?,INTERVIEWER, tomorrow night.,INTERVIEWEE, Betty get over here.,INTERVIEWER, What a pleasure to have as our special guest tonight on larry king live Sir Paul McCartney. If I have to tell you who he is we all have a major problem. His new book is "Blackbird Singing": The Poems and Lyrics From 1965 to 1999." You don't normally do things like this...,INTERVIEWEE, What poetry?,INTERVIEWER, ... lyrics and book poetry.,INTERVIEWEE, No.,INTERVIEWER, Are you a poet?,INTERVIEWEE, Well I mean I tried when I was a kid to write some poetry but it got rejected from the school magazine so I became a songwriter to get my own back. Did OK at that.,INTERVIEWER, Not bad.,INTERVIEWEE, And then what happened was a friend of mine died prematurely of Parkinson's in his early 30s and we were really close. He was the guy who introduced me to John Lennon and he was such a sweet guy. And his passing made me want to write a poem rather than write a song. I don't know why. And since then I've sort of written poems.,INTERVIEWER, Are theythe great Alan Jay Lerner told me that songwriting is not poetry. It's a different craft. Do you agree?,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah. I do agree. Yeah I was persuaded with this book to put lyrics in because the guy who's editing it said some of these lyrics are poems which is kind of the other way around. And I met Allen Ginsberg once the great American poet ...,INTERVIEWER, I know him well. ,INTERVIEWEE, ... who he saidyou know him? He said that Eleanor Rigby is a hell of a poem. So I thought well you know he should know so I was kind of persuaded to do it. But I do think they're different personally you know.,INTERVIEWER, He called lyric writing a kind of a special craft.,INTERVIEWEE, Well if I'd be talking to Allen about poetry he'd correct me when it was kind of a poem. Oh I wouldn't listen to him of course but he'd try and correct my poetry. But if it was a song he'd say I won't try and touch that and he wouldn't dare get involved with the songs.,INTERVIEWER, What is it like to be a "Sir"?,INTERVIEWEE, It's interesting. As my dad would have said is that spelled cur?,INTERVIEWER, Do they dub you? Do they take a little sword and put it on you shoulder?,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah that's probably the best thing. You know what it is? It's like winning a grade school prize that you didn't go in for and they sort of suddenly say he's OK they give you this prize. And you go to the palace and her majesty the Queen of England you've got to kneel down on a little red stool for your knee which is good because my knee was giving me a bit of jip (ph) that day.So I kneeled down and she takes Edward the Confessor's sword... Come on Larry. Voom-voom. I you know arise Sir Paul.,INTERVIEWER, I dub thee...,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah.,INTERVIEWER, ... Sir Paul.,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah.,INTERVIEWER, And yet though when I said "Do you want to be called Sir Paul" you say no.,INTERVIEWEE, Well you know I mean I love the honor but my worry about accepting it was that people would now think I changed and I was like whoa. The guys on my farm said "What do we call you now?" You know it was like "I said you call me sir lordship.",INTERVIEWER, You are a sir. Before webefore we went on we were talking about growing up and I was talking about growing up in Brooklyn and you in Liverpool. But youyou never forget where you're from right?,INTERVIEWEE, I don't. Some people do.,INTERVIEWER, You carry Liverpool with you.,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah I love it. I go back quite frequently. I've got millions of family there.,INTERVIEWER, Friends too?,INTERVIEWEE, Friends too but a lot of family which is breeding as we speak. I mean they just keep on going. They justand to them I'm just our Paul.,INTERVIEWER, Yeah so you're not sir...,INTERVIEWEE, I'm not...,INTERVIEWER, ... and you're not the Beatles and you're not the Wings. You're...,INTERVIEWEE, I have a hard time impressing them. I said...,INTERVIEWER, Is that good for you?,INTERVIEWEE, ... look well I'm famous in the world. Yeah I love it. Of course I do.,INTERVIEWER, What do you do when you're thisdo you pinch yourself saying how did all this happen to me? Do you...,INTERVIEWEE, Of course Larry.,INTERVIEWER, Do you accept it? I mean...,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah.,INTERVIEWER, There's no one who doesn't know you. So what's life like?,INTERVIEWEE, Well you know it's great. Life's great because this is what I wanted to do. I wanted to achieve like you. You know you're out of Brooklyn. You wanted to you know to get famous and make money and all that stuff everyone wants to do. So I did that. So I'm not ever going to try and say I didn'tI don't want to be here. But I think what I doI don't know if you do itbut I separate the famous me from like the private me. And Iwhich is fine. That works great because it's sort of he that goes on stage and gets knighted and he's great you know. And then there's me that was like 5 years old and I remember it. And that's sort of the one I am. I think the awkward thing is I go in Central Park and I'm being this one and they think I'm that one.,INTERVIEWER, Yeah that's the rub right?,INTERVIEWEE, That's the rub.,INTERVIEWER, And how do you deal with that?,INTERVIEWEE, Not very well. I don't like it at all. I said "Can't you see I'm being this one?" Click click click click click. Story. "Go away!" and other words.,INTERVIEWER, So you've paid the price. It's a price you pay for what you wanted.,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah it's OK. It's all right. It's not too bad at all you know. I've been aI can think of worse things.,INTERVIEWER, Did you know early on when you were just the Beatles in little clubs you were good?,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah.,INTERVIEWER, What did you know?,INTERVIEWEE, We were musical. John and I had a little thing that was a little spark of something. The other guys were great musicians. We were a great little unit. I think the thing that I always thought about us was that we were kind of a little bit more artsy than the others. So weyou know John went to art school. I studied literature at school and got a kind ofan A levelcalled an A level. So I did Chaucer and Shakespeare. So it's a little bitslightly more artsy than the other guys in the other bands.,INTERVIEWER, So you knew we can do what we do well?,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah and I thought we had an edge in that artsiness kind of like studenty and just a bit cool. So...,INTERVIEWER, It kind of worked out.,INTERVIEWEE, Ityou know what? It was great.,INTERVIEWER, We'll be right back with Paulie. Is that OK?,INTERVIEWEE, Sure Larry.,INTERVIEWER, There's many stories about why they broke up. Why did...,INTERVIEWEE, The Beatles broke up?,INTERVIEWER, Yeah. Why did you break up? The essence.,INTERVIEWEE, EssenceI think it was time. I always remember the old song "Wedding bells are Breaking up That Old Gang of Mine" you know. The Army buddies the band and you're going to grow up. You're going to get married. You're going to get girlfriends and have babies and things and you don't do that in a band. So I kind of think weif you look at it we really came full circle and...,INTERVIEWER, Was it angry?,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah it got a bit bitter towards the end. We had a sort of strange manager guy who came in from New York and that got bitter. It got a bit of a feud thing going. So we started bitching at each other.,INTERVIEWER, Did you...,INTERVIEWEE, And it was time.,INTERVIEWER, ... did you record after you knew it was going to end? In other words was there anything...,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, ... done after you knew this is it?,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah. There was a little bit of stuff. Yeah which wasn't bad stuff.,INTERVIEWER, No?,INTERVIEWEE, Still good stuff because we were still good musically you know we just may be a little tense as friends now.,INTERVIEWER, That had to be hard though then to go on stage together or no?,INTERVIEWEE, Not on stage recording. We weren't on stage by that time.,INTERVIEWER, When you got enormous what was that like? I mean to come to New York...,INTERVIEWEE, It was fantastic.,INTERVIEWER, ... and I remember in Miami and a crowd...,INTERVIEWEE, It was fantastic. Yeah it was really cool.,INTERVIEWER, What did you make of it though?,INTERVIEWEE, Well I mean we were kids who had looked at America as you know they're a great country like a lot of the world does you know and you're British kids. Elvis Presley you know was from here or Motown all the black artists that we loved from here. Soand we don't have R&B radio stations like in England. You know it's sort of "Good morning and this is Elvis Presley singing his new new song." But here it's like "Yeah (UNINTELLIGIBLE)" you know? And we just loved the radio stations. And it was just fantastic. We arrived. We were in America. We were huge. I think we made a really cool move thatI think George Harrison doesn't remember that we did it but I remember some time saying to Brian Epstein our manager we mustn't go to America until we've got a No. 1 record. A lot of British acts came here and we're like second on the bill to people like Fabian. And in England they were like No. 1 and people were going that's not too cool you know. Second on the bill to Elvis maybe but not Fabian or Frankie Avalon...,INTERVIEWER, So what was the song that brought to you here?,INTERVIEWEE, "I Want To Hold Your Hand.",INTERVIEWER, It was No. 1 and you came.,INTERVIEWEE, No. 1 so we came. So the press said "Hey Beatles where you (UNINTELLIGIBLE)?" We said we're No. 1 man and there's no answering that you know.,INTERVIEWER, You mentioned Presley. What was that meeting like?,INTERVIEWEE, It was great. I loved it. The thing is...,INTERVIEWER, You met the guy.,INTERVIEWEE, ... it was so long agoyeah we met with him in Los Angeles.,INTERVIEWER, And I hear not much was said initially., INTERVIEWEE, Well...,INTERVIEWER, True?,INTERVIEWEE, My memory was that it was really quite straightforward that we loved him. We were a little in awe of him.,INTERVIEWER, Really?,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah. Well he washe was the man you know. We'd grown up with him. We were just kids. We were just a little bit younger and we were in awe. But the funny thing is when we got togetherme George and Ringofor the Beatles anthology got together to discuss it all we all had completely different memories. I said...,INTERVIEWER, Of that meeting?,INTERVIEWEE, Of the meeting. Yeah which is terrible. We didn't have time...,INTERVIEWER, I heard someone say that youhe was hesitant and then they talked about guitars.,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah basshe was trying to learn bass guitar and me being the base player I thought this is cool. Let me show you a couple of licks Elvis.,INTERVIEWER, Hey Elvis.,INTERVIEWEE, No I said he came and met us at the door and Ringo sort of said no he never stood up all evening. So it wasyou know who's telling the truth. I am. But... But I remember him having the first remote control for a TV we'd ever seen. You know...,INTERVIEWER, Really?,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah...,INTERVIEWER, That's a great story.,INTERVIEWEE, And he's just going click click click. And we're going oh it's changing. It seems like ancient history now but it was very modern then.,INTERVIEWER, The John Lennon death where were you?,INTERVIEWEE, I was in England. It was early morning when I heard.,INTERVIEWER, Who told you?, INTERVIEWEE, My manager rang me and Linda had just gone to drop the kids at school. It was that kind of time in the morning. So my manager just rang me and that's where I was.,INTERVIEWER, And he said right out?,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah. He said "You better sit down I've got some really bad news." And then Linda came back and she said "What's wrong" because she could just see I had just gone pale. Yeah that wasthat was some shock.,INTERVIEWER, You had a strangewas strange a good word to describe the relationship you and Johnup and down...,INTERVIEWEE, Not really no. Towards the end when we had these business troubles it got strange but it wasn't strange otherwise. It was very close.,INTERVIEWER, Because you wrote some of the songs. He wrote some of the songs. Right?,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah.,INTERVIEWER, You were the writers the two of you.,INTERVIEWEE, The two of us were the main writers. George wrote "Something in the Way She Moves" and...,INTERVIEWER, Not bad.,INTERVIEWEE, ... "Here goes""Here Comes the Sun." "Something in the Way She Moves" is a Harrison song. Frank Sinatra used to call it his favorite Lennon-McCartney.,INTERVIEWER, He said it right here on this show.,INTERVIEWEE, Did he?,INTERVIEWER, I said not Lennon-McCartney. One of his favorite all-time songs anywhere "Something in the Way She Moves.",INTERVIEWEE, Yeah. It's a great song. He's a great writer. Yeah but John and I were the main writers.,INTERVIEWER, Do you ever think that he got more credit than you?,INTERVIEWEE, No. Iwhat's happened since he died is that...,INTERVIEWER, There's a martyrdom. ... certaincertain peoplethere's a martyrdom thatI had an interview on the day he died when he said "The one last thing I want to ever be is a martyr." Of course that is what happened., He died young., INTERVIEWEE, You can't blame people. You know there's a lot of sympathy. It's such a shocking way to go that you want to try and give him everything. But the trouble is there was a little bit of revisionism where certain people were saying "Well Paul the only thing Paul ever did was" quote"The only thing Paul ever did was book the studio." That kind of thing gets a little bit...,INTERVIEWER, That would bug me because you wrote how many of these?,INTERVIEWEE, A bunch of stuff.,INTERVIEWER, A lotmosta lot of the hits you wrote.,INTERVIEWEE, I wrote a bunch of them yeah.,INTERVIEWER, So when...,INTERVIEWEE, And so you know John and I wrote a lot together and then we wrote a lot separately. And of the ones I wrote there's quite a few of them well-known.,INTERVIEWER, You and Yoko get along?,INTERVIEWEE, We don't not get along. But you know it's like some people you may be destined to not become great buddies with. So it's not that we don't get along just we don't talk much. You know we talk if we have to.,INTERVIEWER, So it's not...,INTERVIEWEE, I don't kind of ring up "Hey Yoko what's happening babe?" We don't do that.,INTERVIEWER, How about Ringo?,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah I love him. He's my dear friend. I spoke to him and George. We're great buddies. We always will be.,INTERVIEWER, How's George doing with the cancer?,INTERVIEWEE, He's good. He's excellent.,INTERVIEWER, He did surgery right?,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah. So I understand. You know I don't know really much about it. I just know he's been on well and he had some surgery. But...,INTERVIEWER, Do you talk frequently?,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah I saw him a couple of weeks ago.,INTERVIEWER, You don't ask about the cancer or anything?,INTERVIEWEE, Well I do but I let him tell me and then I don't tell people on nationwide television in case he wants to keep it private.,INTERVIEWER, Is he OK though?,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah. He's great. He's gorgeous yeah.,INTERVIEWER, Did you ever think of doing something the three of you?,INTERVIEWEE, We did the Beatles anthology to kind of wrap it all up.,INTERVIEWER, That makes sense.,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah people would say "Are you going to reunion?" and do stuff like that. But I certainlyfor me if we were on stage the three of us there'd be someone missing. I'd look over there and there'd be someone missing and that'd be John you know.,INTERVIEWER, The great...,INTERVIEWEE, And so I wouldn't want to do it for that reason.,INTERVIEWER, The great Arthur Fiedler told me once that when you set a toneyou broke rules The Beatles harmonically you broke rules with regard to the way you wrote cord rules you broke and that you lived for that and the true music impresario would know that. Were you always musically aware? In other words are you first a musician?,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah absolutely. My dad was an amateur musician who played piano and trumpet until his teeth gave out. So he was like really good. He played by ear and he was great. He wrote some stuff. He wrote a little song. I always remember to my childhood this tune: da-da-da-da-dah-da-dah doo-deedly-bah. You know real '20s stuff. He was in a little band called...,INTERVIEWER, You are first a musician?,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah definitely.,INTERVIEWER, Are you a good guitarist?,INTERVIEWEE, I'm great Larry.,INTERVIEWER, Great guitarist.,INTERVIEWEE, I'm certainly...,INTERVIEWER, I mean how do you measure yourself?,INTERVIEWEE, I'm good yeah. I'm good.,INTERVIEWER, Because some people say...,INTERVIEWEE, I'm modest too. You know...,INTERVIEWER, That's Liverpool.,INTERVIEWEE, Hey come on.,INTERVIEWER, We're back with Paul McCartney. The book is "Blackbird Singing." We've discussed the death of John Lennon. Tell me about this lyric.,INTERVIEWEE, This is called "Here Today" and it was a song I wrote after John died. I was just thinking about him and remembrance of the good times and not so good times. And I was just having an imaginary conversation with him and so it's...,INTERVIEWER, Did you record it?,INTERVIEWEE, Here you go. Yeah it's on my new record. It's called "Here Today." It says"And if I said I really knew you well what would your answer be if you were here today? Well knowing you you'd probably laugh and say that we were worlds apart if you were here today. But as for me I still remember how it was before and I'm holding back the tears no more. I love you. What about the time we met? Well I suppose you could say that we were playing hard to get. Didn't understand a thing but we could always sing. What about the night we cried because there wasn't any reason left to keep it all inside? Never understood a word but you were always there with a smile. And if I say 'I really loved you and was glad you came along' then you are here today for you are in my song.",INTERVIEWER, Did that go through rewrites?,INTERVIEWEE, No.,INTERVIEWER, That came right out?,INTERVIEWEE, That wasthat just spilled out yeah.,INTERVIEWER, How long did it take you to write that?,INTERVIEWEE, Half an hour something like that. If you're really lucky they just arrive and you kind of just write them down.,INTERVIEWER, By the way with The Beatles did usually the music come first then the lyric or the lyric then the music or all together?,INTERVIEWEE, All together. All together yeah. That'sI only once or twice wrote words and then put a tune to it. That hardly ever happened.,INTERVIEWER, Usually it's music right?,INTERVIEWEE, Music yeah. You normally start with a kind of a guitar or something like dum-dum-dum-dum-dum-dum. Then you go lub- dee-bah-bah doe-bee-do-dah-be-doo-dah-doo-be-dah. And you're this and you kind of go doe-be-doo-dah-bah. "Picks up the rice in the church." What am I saying? "Picks up the rice." Oh well well that's an old lady.,INTERVIEWER, How did you come up with that name "Eleanor Rigby"?,INTERVIEWEE, I had a friend. We had an actress friend that we worked with in the film "Help" who was called Eleanor Bron. So I liked the name Eleanor. I was looking for a real second name. Eleanor Williams is OK. Eleanor Hargrey (ph)it had to be two syllables. And I was walking around in Bristol and saw a shop Rigby. I thought: "You know that's kind of a nice name. It's ordinary but it's special.",INTERVIEWER, Now we had "Jerk of All Jerks." This is the poem.,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah.,INTERVIEWER, Explain how you came up with this.,INTERVIEWEE, Well you know what happened waswhere are we? There. What happened was on the day that John got shot I think like everyone in the world there was this horror that someone we loved could just be mown down. It was like the Kennedy thing you know for a lot of people. They all remembered where they were.,INTERVIEWER, How could one little person do this?,INTERVIEWEE, You know how could this happen? And obviously for me it was just horrifying that that was it. No more John. You know oh my God. I wanted to say this to him. I want to ring him. You know you get that I think when you lose very special people. And at the end of the day after all the tears and all the newscasts and all the pundits who said "John Lennon was"and I'd really said nothing. I couldn't really say anything. I just spurted out a phrase that was meaningless. The phrase that came to me was "jerk of all jerks." I just kept thinking the guy who did this was the jerk of all jerks. So I ended up writing a poem about it.,INTERVIEWER, Do a little.,INTERVIEWEE, Do you want to do a bit? "Jerk of all Jerks." "I'm a motorist that quite likes to drive when he drinks who causes the loss of innocent lives. I'm the guy with the pistol who kills your best friend. You can't really blame me because I'm round the bend. Hello. How are you? I'm jerk of all jerks. I'm here to undo all your charitable works. I do it quite simply by making mistakes and one little boo-boo is all that it takes and you're at the mercy of jerk of all jerks." INTERVIEWER, "I'm the man that disposes of nuclear waste. There's no need to worry it's perfectly safe. In fact there is now every reason to hope that if anything happens I'll easily cope. Hello. How are you? I'm jerk of all jerks. I'm the leader who says as he wages his war that the children are not ones that he's aiming for. Hello. How are you? I'm the jerk of all jerks." You know him don't you?,INTERVIEWER, Yeah.,INTERVIEWEE, You know this guy? Yeah.,INTERVIEWER, Yeah. They executed him yesterday.,INTERVIEWEE, There you go.,INTERVIEWER, On Monday rather. Yeah yesterday morning I guess. Boy itwhew. Now...,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah.,INTERVIEWER, ... poem isthere's no spare word in a poem right?,INTERVIEWEE, Hopefully.,INTERVIEWER, The truth of a poem isrightthere's no word that's wasted.,INTERVIEWEE, Hopefully. Yeah.,INTERVIEWER, Do you enjoy writing as much as you do performing?,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah. I think so. Yeah. Two completely different things. Writing you know is a cerebral thing. You're really trying to be economical. You're trying to get it right. Performing you're reaching out to people. You've got to look at them and relate to them. I think writing's more a solitary thing.,INTERVIEWER, Performing brings though applause.,INTERVIEWEE, Hopefully.,INTERVIEWER, And that's a kind of love thing isn't it?,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah.,INTERVIEWER, We love you...,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah.,INTERVIEWER, ... when they applaud.,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah.,INTERVIEWER, And you can't get that anywhere else but on the stage.,INTERVIEWEE, Oh yes you can Larry.,INTERVIEWER, Ah yes.,INTERVIEWEE, You can get "I love you" in other places.,INTERVIEWER, We're back with Paul McCartney. The occasion is the publication of "Blackbird Singing." And later an extra added attraction. We asked our Internet people to ask questions of Paul McCartney. We picked a few out that we received thousands. And a lot dealt with Linda. And the question they asked was "What was the most important thing you'd like people to know about your late wife?",INTERVIEWEE, About Linda? I think they probably would know it anyway that she was a beautiful kind woman.,INTERVIEWER, We all knew that from just looking at her.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes. Well I'd like people to remember that you know.,INTERVIEWER, How do you deal with loss?,INTERVIEWEE, I'm taking of picture of you in my camera watch here Larry. Just a little...,INTERVIEWER, You're what?,INTERVIEWEE, Just a little modern gimmick I've got going here.,INTERVIEWER, That's a camera watch?,INTERVIEWEE, That's a camera watch. I just took a picture of you. Can you see that?,INTERVIEWER, Look you played it. Can we see this? There it is.,INTERVIEWEE, There it is look at that larry king live.,INTERVIEWER, A camera watch.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes sir. I was doing an interview with some guy. And he's playing around with it. And I said "What is that?" He said "It's a camera watch." He said "Get me one." And he did. He knew the people. So...,INTERVIEWER, And then you could print them out.,INTERVIEWEE, Sorry what was your question? I was fooling around here.,INTERVIEWER, Dealing with loss?,INTERVIEWEE, How do you deal with loss?,INTERVIEWER, I mean this was the woman you were with how many years 30 years?,INTERVIEWEE, I cried30 years. I cried a lot.,INTERVIEWER, You knew it was coming.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes we knew it was coming but youwe tried to pretend we didn't know it was coming. And the last couple of weeks I knew it was coming. I don't know. It's just impossible to talk about or...,INTERVIEWER, I don't want to dwell on it. Do you get angry?,INTERVIEWEE, No not really angry no. I cried a lot. That was the truth of the matter. I just though some friends of mine particularly some of the doctors who were kind of advisingthey said throw yourself into work. Get busy. Do stuff. Do stuff. And I just couldn't. So I just thought that doesn't sound right to me. So I didn't do anything. I just let it all happen. So sometimes I'll be sitting around with people and just burst out crying. And instead of doing the manly thing and say "I'm sorry I shouldn't do it" I would just go "Woo and just cried a lot.",INTERVIEWER, In a business where women are at your fingertips I mean rock stars and who's bigger than the Beatles how did your relationship last so long?,INTERVIEWEE, We loved each other quite simple. I think the other thing was we'd both sown our wild oats before we got together. So I'd known a lot of girls. She'd known a lot of guys. And I think we were kind of fed up with playing the field by the time we got together. And we loved each other. So we were able to say "You know what? Let's knock that stuff on the head and let's get it on.",INTERVIEWER, Did you get mad at cancer?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes yes.,INTERVIEWER, Some people...,INTERVIEWEE, I still do you know. I still do. I think you know it's a terrible thing thatI remember when I was at school which is you know 30 years ago. Now it's more than 30 years ago being asked to give a donation for cancer. And here we are and this still isn't cured. I think we were looking at it getting cured and all that. And so it's scary that it isn't cured and thatbut I don't. You just have to hope for the best and hope that it will soon get cured with the sort of genetic thing. I don't know.,INTERVIEWER, You sort of keep her memory alive though don't you?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, I mean do you work at it?,INTERVIEWEE, Well you know I don't really have to. She's all around me. You know and everybody I know knows her and remembers her. And so I talk a lot about her. She's in the book the poems to her in the book (UNINTELLIGIBLE).,INTERVIEWER, At the end of the program we're going to meet your girlfriend.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, It is right?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, Has she handled this well knowing of your feelings for...,INTERVIEWEE, Yes I think she's handled it particularly well because it's obviously not easy.,INTERVIEWER, Obviously.,INTERVIEWEE, When someone's loved someone for 30 years. I think it's different if it was a divorce because you can say ah the old (UNINTELLIGIBLE). I'll get rid of her. Come on honey. But why am I talking American? I don't know because I'm on your show.,INTERVIEWER, Because you're a guy from Brooklyn yes. How did Wings get together?,INTERVIEWEE, After the Beatles I had to decide whether I was going to give up the music business whether I was going to continue with music. And it was an easy decision. I decided I couldn't. So I just was talking to Linda. And I said you know how would you feel if we got a band together? And would you be in it with me because I like need a friend? She said well I don't know how to do anything. And said yes but bands don't when they start up forgetting that...,INTERVIEWER, there?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes you know nobody knows how to do it. The Beatles were stars nobody knew how to do it. It was a couple of guys with three chords but forgetting that you have a lot of time to make your mistakes in private when you're a young because now I would make these mistakes in public. But we had a lot of fun. ,INTERVIEWER, So Wings was not like an ordinary start up group and that's going to get paid attention to?,INTERVIEWEE, Nowell exactly yes. So we got a lot of criticism any mistakes we made. But we had a lot of fun. We went right back to the roots and just did it all again and enjoyed it.,INTERVIEWER, By the way there's a new two disk compilation titled "Wingspan." Capitol Records will announce the album as doneas gone double platinum in the United States. And a recent "People" magazine says that Wings brought us the purest pop for pop's purest decade that brief period after music stopped selling revolution and before it began selling naval rings." So youwhat are you doing now? Do you sing?,INTERVIEWEE, I sing. I'm here in Los Angeles to maketo finish up a new record.,INTERVIEWER, As just Sir Paul McCartney or as a group?,INTERVIEWEE, Oh it's just Paul McCartney yes. It's just yes it's not a group. It's justI work with a group. And it comes out under my name.,INTERVIEWER, CD or a single song?,INTERVIEWEE, CD yes CD new album.,INTERVIEWER, You wrote them?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, Do you ever sing anybody else's material?,INTERVIEWEE, Not on record. Off the record I do.,INTERVIEWER, In concerts you will?,INTERVIEWEE, I don't think I do actually. No I think it's nearly always my stuff.,INTERVIEWER, Another...,INTERVIEWEE, Sometimes some old rock and roll.,INTERVIEWER, Another Internet question. What one song you've written has the most personal meaning to you?,INTERVIEWEE, There are a few. It's always difficult to choose one you know.,INTERVIEWER, Yes I know. ,INTERVIEWEE, So "My Love" maybe "I'm Amazed" very special because I wrote them for Linda. So they will always have a special meaning. "Here Today" because I wrote that for John. I think those kind of songs. There's a more recent one called "Little Willow" that I wroteI think songs like that then it doesn't mean they're any better but they have more meaning because I wrote them for a reason.,INTERVIEWER, What was the biggest McCartney written hit?,INTERVIEWEE, "Yesterday.",INTERVIEWER, An amazing song.,INTERVIEWEE, Not bad.,INTERVIEWER, Yes. Where did that come from that?,INTERVIEWEE, It came in a dream unto me. I woke up one morning and I heard...,INTERVIEWER, The music too?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes only the music. So I thought that's a good tune. I wonder what that is. Yes. And I had a piano by my bed like you do.,INTERVIEWER, Oh everyone...,INTERVIEWEE, As most people. And I was sitting at my piano. Anyway so I said "What is this tune? I blocked it out." Then I went to all my friends John first George Martin our producer. I said "What is this tune?" He said I don't know but it's good. I couldn't believe I'd written it.,INTERVIEWER, What does it meanthat you've heard it somewhere?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes I'd heard it. I thought it was so complete. And I used tobecause I didn't have any words I used to sing "Scrambled eggs oh my baby how I love your legs." But I thought that cannot stay. We've got to look for other lyrics. So over the next couple of weeks I got the real words.,INTERVIEWER, Did "Yesterday" just drop at you like that?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes. Yes. The words took a little longer but the tune itself came just complete came just out of a dream. So you've got to believe in magic.,INTERVIEWER, Yes.,INTERVIEWEE, The thing about songwriting it's quite a mystical thing how people do it you know. It sort of just come to you if you're lucky.,INTERVIEWER, Ella Gardner told me that "Misty" he thought someone had written it because he couldn't read any music and it was going through his head?,INTERVIEWEE, Me and Ella that's because I can't read or write music either.,INTERVIEWER, You can't read or write music?,INTERVIEWEE, No.,INTERVIEWER, So when you think of something someone has to write it down?,INTERVIEWEE, Or I've got to remember it. Me and John always used to say because wewhen we first started it was before anything like tape cassettes which we later used to just immediately put it down. Said okay remember. And we said what if we forget it? We said so you know if we forget it it can't be much good. How are going to expect them to remember if we just wrote it and we forgot it?,INTERVIEWER, When Paul you make it and have it all whatyou're going to be 59-years old right? What goals do you now have? I mean it can't be financial.,INTERVIEWEE, No.,INTERVIEWER, OK. It can't beare there are artistic goals left?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes. I...,INTERVIEWER, Like what?,INTERVIEWEE, Well you know I'm still looking to write a great song. You always are. You know you never think well that's enough. Well that's good enough.,INTERVIEWER, That's right. Irving Berlin was writing into his 90s.,INTERVIEWEE, Exactly. Yes how cool was that? And he wasso I would always hope to be able to just write a better song. You know I was looking to do that. But I like a lot of things. I like poetry. I paint. There's a lot of stuff I do.,INTERVIEWER, Where do you live?,INTERVIEWEE, I live in England two hours south of London.,INTERVIEWER, You have high security?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, I just don't want what happened to John...,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, What happened to George...,INTERVIEWEE, Yes. ,INTERVIEWER, You must worry?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes well I don't worry you know because...,INTERVIEWER, You don't?,INTERVIEWEE, No because the moment the man upstairs wants me I'm his. You know it's call.,INTERVIEWER, You believe that?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes I know that. You know.,INTERVIEWER, You know that?,INTERVIEWEE, Well I know that at some point I'm going to die. And that's it. So I don't worry about it.,INTERVIEWER, But you do have security?,INTERVIEWEE, I tried to avoid it by the way.,INTERVIEWER, Yes.,INTERVIEWEE, You know I'm not...,INTERVIEWER, Good thinking. But I mean do you think Linda is somewhere?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, Do you feel that?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, That sensitive that...,INTERVIEWEE, She's here sort of in this kind of dimensional thing. I don't know. I don't have any sort of very strong religious beliefs but I have kind ofI'm a spiritual feelings about that kind of thing.,INTERVIEWER, What American artists flip you?,INTERVIEWEE, Elvis Presley the king.,INTERVIEWER, The first right.,INTERVIEWEE, Absolutely yes. Greatest.,INTERVIEWER, Who else out of that rock...,INTERVIEWEE, Little Richard who always says it on TV. Paul you know he said you know I taught you everything you know. I said "That's right Richard. It's true." Little Richard was fantastic. Jerry Lee Louis Jean Vincent all of them. And then the next wave was Motown Marvyn Gaye and Smokey Robinson and all the town with Motown.,INTERVIEWER, What do you like now?,INTERVIEWEE, What do I like now? Nat King Cole. I'm going backwards Larry. The very thought of you...,INTERVIEWER, Now he had a voice like no voice.,INTERVIEWEE, Really cool.,INTERVIEWER, (UNINTELLIGIBLE).,INTERVIEWEE, I love him yes. And I talk to her about it. I tell her it's about my favorite song. Me and Heather's favorite song is...,INTERVIEWER, "Unforgettable?",INTERVIEWEE, No "The Very Thought of You.",INTERVIEWER, Oh.,INTERVIEWEE, You know that one?,INTERVIEWER, And (UNINTELLIGIBLE) the little ordinary things that everyone ought to do.,INTERVIEWEE, Well exactly.,INTERVIEWER, I see your face in every flower. I know songs.,INTERVIEWEE, You do know that one. It's a great song.,INTERVIEWER, Did you like Sinatra?,INTERVIEWEE, Written by an Englishman there too. Yes I did like Sinatra a lot. I didn't appreciate him when I was younger. I love him now. I think it's a sort of romance thing too. That kind of stuff is really romantic music.,INTERVIEWER, Do you like rap?,INTERVIEWEE, I like it. I don't really listen to a lot of it. I like some of the Eminem stuff because it's kind of clever. I like the rhythm. I like the attitude. And I can imagine if I was a young kid now I'd like that.,INTERVIEWER, Do you ever hear a song where you say "I wish I wrote that.",INTERVIEWEE, One or two yes.,INTERVIEWER, One or two?,INTERVIEWEE, One or two.,INTERVIEWER, Like "The Very Thought of You?",INTERVIEWEE, "Very Thought of You" would have been good to have written.,INTERVIEWER, President Barack Obama is next on larry king live. President Obama faces enormous challenges on his 500th day in office. I sat down with him at the White House today to discuss some of them. And we began by talking about an environmental disaster that has no end in sight. Mr. President thank you for being with us on our 25th anniversary week.,INTERVIEWEE, Larry congratulations on 25 wonderful years.,INTERVIEWER, Thank you. It's been a special honor. ,INTERVIEWEE, Unbelievable.,INTERVIEWER, And an honor to be here and be with you.,INTERVIEWEE, Thank you.,INTERVIEWER, I know you're going down to the Gulf again. But there's a question that a lot of us are pondering. After this is over what about hurricanes? What about oil raining down? have we thought about what we're going to do when it's over?,INTERVIEWEE, Well this is an unprecedented oil spill. We haven't seen likeanything like this before. And that's why the minute that the rig blew up and then sank down to the bottom of the ocean I called in my entire team. And I have to tell you Larry that the worst case scenario was even worse than what we're seeing now because...,INTERVIEWER, This is worse than what you thought it would be?,INTERVIEWEE, No no no. What I'm saying is it could have...,INTERVIEWER, Oh.,INTERVIEWEE, been even worse. So we realized right away this was going to be a big event a big problem and that we had to put everything we had into it. So right away we started mobilizing our Coast Guard making sure that we are putting pressure on BP to activate their response. Eventually we ended up sending our top scientists. We now have about 100 of the top scientists from around the world in our national labsto look over BP's shoulder in terms of figuring out how they're going to plug the well. And we also knew though that ultimately the only way to relieve the well safely is to drill what are called these relief wells. Now BP and other oil companies traditionally just drill one. We said drill two in case one of them doesn't work. But that takes some time. It takes about three months. In the meantime they've been experimenting with a whole bunch of other ways that they can capture the oil. But we've had a big spill. And we know that it's going to be a long response a long cleanup. And my commitment has always beenfor the last 40 some days to make sure that we are doing everything we can to mitigate the damage to help clean up help recover because this is an area that already got battered during hurricane season. And this is an area that is a concern not only for the economy of the Gulf but also for an entire way of life. ,INTERVIEWER, Have the scientists discussed what about a hurricane?,INTERVIEWEE, You know Wolf I didI had a Situation Room meeting about a week-and-a-half ago where we got the report that this could be a more severe than normal hurricane season. And I asked well how does a potential oil spill interact with a hurricane? And it turns out thatand now these are all estimations and probabilities. It turns out that a big powerful hurricane ironically is probably less damaging with respect to the oil spill because it just disperses everything and the oil breaks up andand degrades more quickly. It's those tropical storms and tides that would just wash stuff into the marshes that would really be an ecological disaster. But look wewe've got a couple of tasks right now. Number one BP has to shut down this well. Now the only guarantee to shut it down is the relief well and that's going to take a couple of months. In the meantime we hope that by cutting the riser and putting a cap on this thing they can funnel up the oil and that will help. In the meantime we've still got all these barrels of oil that are sloshing around in the Gulf. They move with the currents. We don't always know where they are. But what we can do is make sure that our response doesn't hold anything back that we put everything we've got into Louisiana which has been hardest hit so far; Alabama Mississippi and Florida.,INTERVIEWER, Senator Nelson wants the Defense Department he says more fully involvedmore troops.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes. You know I think that there's a mistaken understanding. First of all the Coast Guard is part of our armed services and they're responsible for the coordinating along with the responsible partyin this case BPto make sure that recovery efforts are top notch. And what I've said to Thad Allen who's the national incident coordinator and is somebody who has been dealing with oil spills for 39 years now is whatever you need you will get.,INTERVIEWER, So if he says troops he'll get troops?,INTERVIEWEE, If heif he says that there's equipment that's helpful in dealing with this problem he will get it. But keep in mind that all this stuff has to be coordinated. Right now we've got over 20000 people who are working there. We've authorized the activation of 17000 National Guardsmen. We've got 1700 vessels already in the water. And you know what you don't want is a situation where everybody is stepping on each other and not doing the best possible job in coordination with the state and local levels.,INTERVIEWER, What part of it is your baby? what part of it is the country and not BP?,INTERVIEWEE, Well BP caused this spill. We don't yet know exactly what happened. But whether it's a combination of human error them cutting corners on safety or a whole other variety of variables they're responsible. So they've got to pick up thethe tab for the cleanup the damages fishermen who are unable to fish right in the middle of their most important season. And my job is to make sure that they are being held accountable that we get to the bottom of how this happened that they are paying what they're supposed to be paying that they cap this well. In terms of actually solving the problem BP has particular expertise when it comes to capping the well. They've got the equipment thatthat our Defense Departmentthe first thing I asked was do we have some equipment that they don't have? And they along with other oil companies have the best equipment and have the best technology to deal with the well at the bottom of the ocean. What we have a responsibility for is to make sure that the recovery efforts the mitigation efforts along the coastline making sure that fishermen and businesses that are being affected are getting paid properly making sure that local people are being hiredall those efforts are ones where we can do it better. And so what we've said is you're going to pay. You will coordinateBPwith us. But ultimately if we say that you need to deploy folks over there or you need to compensate such and such here or you need to for example most recently help to dredge up and create some barrier islands in some selective areas of Louisiana in accordance with some of the ideas that the state had down there then you need to do it.,INTERVIEWER, SomeI know youyou appear so calm. Are you angry at BP?,INTERVIEWEE, You know I am furious at this entire situation because this is an example of where somebody didn't think through the consequences of their actions. And it is imperiling not just a handful of people this isthis is imperiling an entire way of life and an entire region for potentially years. So...,INTERVIEWER, Has the company felt your anger?,INTERVIEWEE, Well they have felt the anger. But what I haven't seen as much as I'd like is the kind of rapid response. Now they want to solve the problem too because this is costcosting them a lot of money. And the one thing that I think is important to underscore is that I would love to just spend a lot of my time venting and yelling at people. But that's not the job I was hired to do. My job is to solve this problem. And ultimately this isn't about me and how angry I am. Ultimately this is about the people down in the Gulf who are being impacted and what am I doing to make sure that they're able to salvage their way of life? And that's going to be the main focus that I've got in the weeks and months ahead.,INTERVIEWER, Governor Jindal the governor of Louisiana he's asked you tohe's got concerns about the impact of stoppingof the moratorium you have on drilling. And now that's been extended toto the shallow waters as well. What would you say to him?,INTERVIEWEE, Well actually the moratorium has not extended to the shallow waters. It's only...,INTERVIEWER, Oh that's wrong?,INTERVIEWEE, It's only theit's only the deep water wells that we've placed a moratorium. Look we've just seen an environmental disaster that's come about because these oil companies said they had a plan to deal with the worst case scenario and obviously it wasn't a very good plan because it's not working Larry. And nobody is being impacted more than the citizens of Louisiana Bobby Jindal's state So I have said in the past that we need to transition to a more clean energy future. But we're not going to do that overnight. We've got to have domestic oil production. And I am supportive of offshore drilling if it can be done safely and it doesn't result in these kinds of horrible environmental disasters. And the problem I've got is until I've got a review that tells me A what happened; B how do you prevent a blowout of the sort that we saw; C if even if it's a one in a million chance something like this happens again that we actually know how to deal with it. Until that happens it would be irresponsible of me to lift that moratorium.,INTERVIEWER, A couple of other things. Former President Carter has condemned the Israeli raid against those ships in thethe flotilla trying to break the blockade of Gaza. Where do you stand on that? A former American president has condemned it.,INTERVIEWEE, Well you know the United States with the other members of the U.N. Security Council said very clearly that we condemned all the acts that led up to this violence. It was a tragic situation. You've got loss of life that was unnecessary. And so we are calling for an effective investigation of everything that happened. And I think that the Israelis are going to agree to thatan investigation of international standardsbecause they recognize that this can't be good for Israel's long-term security. Here's what we've got. You've got a situation in which Israel has legitimate security concerns when they've got missiles raining down on cities along the Israel/Gaza border. I've been to those towns and seen the holes that were made by missiles coming through people's bedrooms. So Israel has a legitimate concern there. On the other hand you've got a blockade up that is preventing people in Palestinian Gaza from having job opportunities and being able to create businesses and engage in trade and have opportunity for the future. I think what's important right now is is that we break out of the current impasse use this tragedy as an opportunity so that we figure out how can we meet Israel's security concerns but at the same time start opening up opportunity for Palestinians work with all parties concernedthe Palestinian Authority the Israelis the Egyptians and othersandand I think Turkey can have a positive voice in this whole process once we've worked through this tragedyand bring everybody together to figure out how can we get a two-state solution where Palestinians and Israelis can live side by side in peace and security.,INTERVIEWER, It's premature then to condemn Israel?,INTERVIEWEE, Well II think that we need to know what all the facts are. But it's not premature to say to the Israelis and to say to the Palestinians and to say to all the parties in the region that the status quo is unsustainable. We have been trying to do this piecemeal for decades now and it just doesn't work. You've got to have a situation in which the Palestinians have real opportunity and Israel's neighbors recognize Israel's legitimate security concerns and are committed to peace.,INTERVIEWER, You met with the Arizona governor today.,INTERVIEWEE, Um-hmm.,INTERVIEWER, Will the administration bring a legal challenge to that law?,INTERVIEWEE, You know I'm not going to comment on that Larry because that's really the job of the Justice Department. And you know I made a commitment early on that I wouldn't be putting my handthumb on the scales when these kinds of decisions are made. I've expressed a personal opinion which is that although I understand the frustration of the people of Arizona when it comes to the inflow of illegal immigrants I don't think this is the right way to do it. I think this puts American citizens who look Hispanic are Hispanic potentially in a unfair situation and...,INTERVIEWER, But you're not going to ,INTERVIEWEE, And more importantly it also creates the prospects of 50 different laws in 50 different states when it comes to immigration. This is a federal job. What we have to do is take on that federal responsibility by working with border states on border security. And I told Governor Brewer that we've already put more resources into border security than we ever have. We have got more border guards in Arizona than we ever had. We've gotwe just made decisions to put in additional National Guard. But without comprehensive immigration reform that is Congress' responsibility we are not going to solve this problem and that's what we have to do.,INTERVIEWER, A couple of other quick things because I know we have a little bit of a time limit. First do you still like this job?,INTERVIEWEE, Well this is the best job on earth. I mean it's ait's an extraordinary privilege to be able to wake up every day and know that you have the opportunity to serve the American people andand make their lives a little bit better or maybe it's the next generation's lives a little bit better. And...,INTERVIEWER, No matter what a poll says?,INTERVIEWEE, You know what the truth of the matter is is that given everything we've gone through my poll numbers are doing all right.,INTERVIEWER, It's 48 percent. Is that all right?,INTERVIEWEE, You know thewe've gone through the worst recession since the Great Depression. We've got two wars going on right now. We've had multiple crises that have cropped up and people still haven't fully recovered in terms of their job losses in terms of what's happening in housing. So you know people I think understandably are frustrated. But what they're starting to see is that the economy is getting better. We had the biggest job growth in years last month and I think we'll have decent job growth this month...,INTERVIEWER, Tomorrow it will come out.,INTERVIEWEE, Tomorrow we'll get an announcement. Businesses are starting to invest again. Manufacturing is stronger than it's been. The investments that we made early onsome of which were controversialare paying off. If you look at just to give you one example the auto industry. I mean G.M. is now turning a profit and hiring again. And the banks as frustrating as you know the situation of having to bail them out was they are repaying that money. And so a lot of the decisions that are being made are starting to pan out. But we're not out of the woods yet. People are still hurting. And you know it is a great privilege for me to have the most interesting job in the world and one where every once in a while I'll get a letter from somebodyyou know II was traveling through Iowa. A woman comes up to me and says you know what that healthcare bill you passed I'm a small business woman I'm going to take advantage of that credit this year. This is going to help me and I might be able to hire somebody else because you just gave me the chance to get decent healthcare.,INTERVIEWER, And one other thing. LeBron James is with us tomorrow night. We pre-interviewed him. And he says all things being equal he's probably leaning toward Cleveland. That's where he grew up in Akron. But he grew up a Bull fan. You want him to go to Chicago right?,INTERVIEWEE, No no no. I...,INTERVIEWER, What did you say?,INTERVIEWEE, I want to be clear. What Iwhat I said to...,INTERVIEWER, Clear it up.,INTERVIEWEE, First of all LeBron I've had a chance to meet hima wonderful young man an amazing talent. What I said to him wasII didn't say it to him I said it to Marv Albert. He needs to be in a place where he's got a coach and a team around him that can do what Phil Jackson and the Bulls did for Michael Jordan. Michael Jordan couldn't win a championship on his own. It's all about having a team concept that works. And he hasn't quite gotten that yet and he needs to find that situation. I'll be honest with youand my folks in Chicago may be mad at me for saying this but I think it would be a wonderful story if LeBron says you know what I'm going to stay here in Cleveland. You know he's from Ohio. You know thatthat's a town that has had some tough times. For him to say...,INTERVIEWER, Wow!,INTERVIEWEE,I'm going to make a commitment to this city you know I think would be a wonderful thing. But he's got to make sure that he's got a team around him and a coach that he respects he's bought into a team concept he's willing to be coached. Andand if he does that he'll have an even more remarkable career than he's having right now.,INTERVIEWER, I saw you singing to "Michelle" last night withwith Paul McCartney. That was a pretty nice kick huh?,INTERVIEWEE, Letlet me tell you theI think that was one of the highlights that Michelle's had is when Paul McCartney sings "Michelle." To her you knowwhen she was a little girl growing up on the south side of Chicago I suspect she didn't think that was ever going to happen.,INTERVIEWER, Thank you Mr. President.,INTERVIEWEE, Thank you Larry. Appreciate you.,INTERVIEWER, Thanks for celebrating with us.,INTERVIEWEE, Congratulations again.,INTERVIEWER, On this our 25th anniversary week here at CNN we're so excited to welcome Lady Gaga to larry king live§. She's the Grammy- winning singer songwriter musician performance artist whose provocative videos have been viewed more than one billion times online. And later in the show we're going to give you a sneak peek of her latest video "Alejandro." She just received five world music awards in May and is one of the top winners at the 2010 Brit Awards. Lady Gaga has sold more than 15 million albums and 40 million singles worldwide. And "TIME" magazine recently published this annual list of the 100 Most Influential People in the World. Lady Gaga was on the cover as one of those people. Were you surprised at that?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes of course. I was so surprised. I didn't even imagine that I would make the list at all. And I was so excited and I am very blessed to have the wonderful fans that I do who voted for me. Should I call you Larry or should I call you King Larry?,INTERVIEWER, Well King Larry would be a great honor but let's do Larry and I'll do Gaga.,INTERVIEWEE, OK.,INTERVIEWER, OK. You were born Stefaniwhy did you change yourhow did you come up with Lady Gaga? ,INTERVIEWEE, Well it was actually a nickname that some of my friends called me in New York. I was doing these performance art pop music pieces in the city. And they were a bit on the eccentric side I suppose. So people started to call me Gaga after the Queen song "Radio Gaga.",INTERVIEWER, At what age growing up Gaga did you know that you wanted to be a performer?,INTERVIEWEE, In the womb Larry. In my mother's warm womb.,INTERVIEWER, At your birth.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes at my birth. I guess you could say it's always been my destiny to be a performer. I used to perform even just in restaurants with my family or in the living room. But it's been really a very exciting transition now that I get to do this for a living. And I just refuse to stop. I probably should take a break and go on vacation. But I'd rather die on stage. Not under a palm tree.,INTERVIEWER, Before you were a performer did you have any other jobs?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes well I was a waitress for many years. And a bartender. And I was a go-go dancer briefly as well. I used to make a lot of money to pay for demos and flyers that I used to post up all around the NYU area on the lower east side to get people to come see my shows. I got a job when I was 15 because my allowance was about $20 a week which in New York was impossible. So I used to waitress across the street from where I grew up. And I used to take all the money I made waitressing so that I could go watch jazz downtown.,INTERVIEWER, Wow. You said that people use the word icon carelessly. Do you consider yourself an icon?,INTERVIEWEE, No I do not. I hope when I'm dead I'll be considered an icon though.,INTERVIEWER, Who are your icons? Who does Lady Gaga look up to?,INTERVIEWEE, Who do I look up to? My mother. My grandmother. I love Princess Diana. So much. She haswas an enormous influence on me when I was younger because my mother worshipped her so much. Her story how she began what she married into how her society affected her as a woman. I was always very fascinated with Princess Diana. When she died it wasI'll never forget. My mother was crying sitting on the couch watching the news and I was very young. And it was this very powerful moment in my childhood watching my mother so connected to someone. So I guess you could say she is one of my biggest icons. As well as you know David Bowie wonderful. And ,INTERVIEWER, Did the family encourage you to sing and dance and perform?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes. My mother was actually in musical theater when she was younger and my dad was in a Bruce Springsteen cover band for many years. He was a real Jersey Shore boy. And they were always very supportive. They alwaysyou know I think more than anything in my house growing up my parents instilled a very strong work ethic in me and my sisters. So as long as I worked hard at whatever it is that I wanted to do they were OK with me doing it. But if I was ever lazy I wouldI would reckon that they would perhaps not want me to do it.,INTERVIEWER, There's been a lot of stories and stories so often wrong about your health. How are you?,INTERVIEWEE, I'm OK thank you Larry. How are you?,INTERVIEWER, I'm OK. I mean you look great. Is there any there was a story about lupus or something? Do you have lupus?,INTERVIEWEE, You know lupus is in my family and it is genetic. And it's so funny because my mother told me the other day that my fans were quite worried about me because they did talk about the fact that I was tested for lupus. And the truth is I don't show any signs any symptoms of lupus. But I have tested borderline positive for the disease. So as of right now I doI do not have it. But I have to take good care of myself.,INTERVIEWER, Yes sure you have to be very precautionary. Death though is a theme in a number of your performances. You're only 24. You've been eaten by a giant Anglo fish on stage crushed by a falling chandelier during a 2009 MTV Music. Do you think about dying?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes I do. Iyou know I ,INTERVIEWER, At age 24?,INTERVIEWEE, It's something Iwell I dream about it a lot. You know II don't know. I suppose I could lie to you and not tell you the truth but the truth is I do think about it. The Anglo fish in the show actually was my childhood monster. My big fear was of the Anglo fish. So it was kind of comical to use it in the show that I battle my childhood fear every night before the finale. But I don't know. I actuallyI am a good friend with Deepak Chopra who I speak to a lot about my dreams. And he seems to think it's nothing really to worry about. He tells me that I'm very creative and I should learn to embrace my insanity and not worry so much because I always call him and saying Deepak I had this most horrible morbid dream. What does it all mean? And he says you're just very creative. Put it on stage.,INTERVIEWER, Of course Deepak is on this program a lot. He never worries about anything. He doesn't. He's a wonderful person.,INTERVIEWEE, He is a wonderfulhe is a wonderful person. I wish I could be more like that. But you know I think part of my fascination with it as well as why it is in this show is that the show is a celebration of shame. The show is a rejection of insecurity. The monster ball is in essence an exorcism for my fans and for myself where we sort of put everything out on the table and reject it. There is so much in the show about insecurity and struggle. And so many of my fans are really really really troubled. And I was really troubled. And I still am fairly troubled. So I guess you can say I relate to my fans in that way. And I choose not to hide from it. I'm not interested Larry in being a perfect placid pop singer that looks great in bikinis and is on the cover of every magazine. I'm more interested in helping my fans to love who they are and helping them to reject prejudice and reject those things that they're taught from society to not like themselves.,INTERVIEWER, Well said.,INTERVIEWEE, Feel like freaks.,INTERVIEWER, Much morewe'll take a break ,INTERVIEWEE, Like they're not wanted.,INTERVIEWER, We're back with Lady Gaga. It's our 25th anniversary week. We're honored to have her be one of our featured guests. Bill Gates will be with us tomorrow night. And Lebron James Friday night. We're very diversified. We have a question for you Gaga. It's on our Facebook page. Is it true that Michael Jackson wanted to perform with you on his "This Is It" comeback tour?,INTERVIEWEE, You know it's always very difficult because I don't necessarily like to talk about those very personal things that happened. But I guess I can speak about it now. I was actually asked to open for Michael on his tour. And we were going to open for him at the O2 and we were working on making it happen.,INTERVIEWER, Wow.,INTERVIEWEE, And I suppose I believe there was some talk about uslots of the openers doing duets with Michael on stage. Sobut Michael's death was devastating for me regardless of whether or not I was supposed to go on tour with him. He is such an inspiration and remarkable human being. And I guess I suppose Larry some of my fascination with death and the demise of the celebrity goes along with me watching these hugely iconic and amazing people that I have heralded and admired my whole life become destroyedwhether self-destroyed or destroyed by the media.,INTERVIEWER, How did you come up with the ideathe incredible idea of these costumes? Of not just singing and dancing but the way you present yourself. How did that come about?,INTERVIEWEE, Well some of the things I wear are obviously created for me by designers or they're recreations of archives of things worn in the '70s and in the '80s. But lots of the newer more original pieces they're meant to be kind of a rejection of what people view about women. I guess I'm a feminist. I am a feminist. And I want to change the way people view women and changeI guess it's not quite sure what she definitely means by her work but Marina Bromovich the performance artist she seems to be quite limitless and she seems to say that somehow she or we create our own limits. So I guess I'm trying to push the limits push the boundaries as much as I can. And I also really lovelove the way I dress. And it brings me a personal joy and satisfaction in my own life that I like to share with my fans. I also try to create things that are quite easy for my fans to replicate. Some of them not so much. But some of them are very easy for my fans to replicate and that bonds us in a way. It's quite nice to have this connection to them outside of everything else. Yes.,INTERVIEWER, Is there any boundary you won't cross?,INTERVIEWEE, I suppose I'll justwell you'll have to wait Larry. I'm not sure. I'm not interested in violence. Yes I don't like violence. I hate violence. I don't like negativity. I don't like prejudice. I don't believe in hatred in music. So there are some things I suppose.,INTERVIEWER, Well said. You said that your 2008 single "Just Dance" that single saved your life. That was a quote from "The Sunday Observer." How?,INTERVIEWEE, Well of course people love to take sound bites from nice interviews that I give. But it saved my life I guess injust as in a transitional way in terms of where I was in the journey of my music. And I had moved to Los Angeles and I'd been dropped from record labels a few times and been through so many obstacles and told no and rejected you're not pretty enough can't sing enough can't write a song good enough. You're a freak the weird girl from New York. I mean it was a rejection after rejection. And I wrote this song "Just Dance." And it was myit's my eureka moment. It was the thing that everyone was able to latch on to the record label the gay community who has been the most enormous blessing of my life that I have them and their support and the way that they truly understand me and support me. And in fact the "Alejandro" video which will premier very soon but you'll see a snippet of it tonight is a celebration of my love and appreciation for the gay community. My admiration of their bravery and their love for one another their courage in their relationships. It's something I have yet toyet to nail on the head with a man Larry.,INTERVIEWER, We're back with the fantastic Lady Gaga on this our 25th anniversary week. We'll be joined Thursday night by the president of the United States Barack Obama. You said Lady Gaga that you don't touch cocaine anymore. Was it hard to stop doing it?,INTERVIEWEE, No it wasn't. By the time that I had stopped doing it it was ruining my life. So no I kind of just threw it away I guess.,INTERVIEWER, British tabloids say that you recentlyI want to get this right. You walked into a local pub in Birmingham. You had a few drinks and picked up everybody's tab when you left. True?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes. What's wrong with buying a few friends a beer?,INTERVIEWER, All right. You're in the midst now of a massive world tour. In fact you're coming to us from the O2 arena in London where you'll be performing. What is that pressure like?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, To go on that kind of tour?,INTERVIEWEE, It's a wonderful pressure. It's the most amazing pressure. It's not like any other kind of pressure. It's not under pressure it's not water pressure. It's not pressure cooker. It's just wonderful. It's miraculous. I'm so blessed. I look out into the audience and I scream and cry and we sing and we cheer and we dance. And I can't believe that 17000 people singing my lyrics or that even know my name. And I'm soI'm so grateful Larry. I can't say enough about my little monsters my beautiful fans. They inspire me so much. I've been writing my new album on the road every day. It's been a wonderful experience. Of course I always want to be better but not a bad pressure. A good wonderful pressure.,INTERVIEWER, All right. How do you come up with the little monsters idea? What does that mean?,INTERVIEWEE, Well I wrote the album "The Fame Monster" which is the second album. And when I had finished I realized that I had written each song about a particular fear that I had come across on my journey promoting the fame. And then when I went on tour my fans were sothey were salivating at the mouth and they couldn'tthey were rabid. They couldn't wait for me to sing my new songs and they just behaved like monsters onin the audience. So a couple of nights I just said you little monsters. And I hadI had used the lyric on the album as well little monsters. So I just started calling them my little monsters. And before I knew it they were all holding their hands up like this in the audience. And then this became the symbol for the little monster. And now they standthey stand in the audience every night and they dance and they hold up their monster hands.,INTERVIEWER, We have a Tweeter question for Lady Gaga Twittered to us. "If you weren't in show business what do you think you'd be doing?",INTERVIEWEE, I would be dead.,INTERVIEWER, Simply put you wouldn't be here?,INTERVIEWEE, No. I also wouldso much of what I do is hinged on show business. I believe so much in itpeople ask me what do you dress like when you're alone? Do you ever just wear sweat pants or whatever they say. And I'm thinking that theythe concept of show business is lost. Michael Jackson when he was being wheeled out of the ambulance when he was burned he held his glitter glove up high above his head to was to his fans because he was show business.,INTERVIEWER, You have become a champion of what you call All the Freaks. Now explain isis everybody a freak? Or are you appealing to freaks? Or are there millions of freaks? Explain it?,INTERVIEWEE, Well III havesince my childhood in school and for a very long time I used to always feel like such a freak. I didn't have very many friends in school. I had a few close friends. And II wasn't a popular girl. And got made fun of every day and couldn't really relate to anyone and didn't want do dress like anyone else and liked different things. And I related to men more than I related to women. And I felt like a freak and I had no where to go. And I guess through the music and the performances we've donethe clothing that I've worn and as the fan base has begun to grow I've sort of watched this massive group of misfits join together to liberate themselves. They love the music and they love what the House of Gaga is creating because it has a sense of individuality a sense of freedom a sense of non-conformconformity. And Iand I celebrate that. I joke in the show. at the beginning of the show I say all the freaks are outside and I locked the doors. It'sit's kind of the opposite of what you're saying Larry. We believe that we aren't the freaks that everyone else is the freaks.,INTERVIEWER, Your videos are hugely popular on the Internet. They've also been remade by other people like U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan who parody "Telephone." Or the 12 year old Gracen Chance (ph) performing "Paparazzi." What havedo you like all these imitators?,INTERVIEWEE, Well yes of course but it's actually very interesting that you brought up the soldiers in Afghanistan because I specifically didn't post that one when I saw it. I wanted to put that on my Twitter but I got nervous about posting it on my Twitter because I was not sure how it would be received by the other soldiers or the other you know members of the Army or the administration. So I didn't post it. And then it's quite interesting that all thesethese Don't Ask Don't Tell is happening now that it's happening because in the Alejandro video there is sort of this homoerotic military theme in the video. And it kind of makes perfect sense doesn't it? Itit all kind of comes together culturally and politically. And IIit's no secret that II don't think that anyone should have to hide who they are let alone be discriminated against. We can all fight equally.,INTERVIEWER, Sure.,INTERVIEWEE, But II bring that up specifically because it makes me sad that I saw that video. And I thought it was so great. And I was so excited that over in Afghanistan they're fighting every day for us and they're protecting us and doing so much. And they were just having a little down time. And I had to think twice before I posted it because I didn't want anything bad to happen.,INTERVIEWER, We have of course gotten tons of Tweets Lady Gaga about the soon to be released video of your song Alejandro. When will it be released?,INTERVIEWEE, It will be released in just a few days. And I wanted to make sure that my fans had something nice and foreshadowing to watch tonight on LARRY KING.,INTERVIEWER, We mentioned Madonna earlier. And many articles wereabout you refer to Madonnacomparisonsparallels. What do you make of all that? What do you think of her?,INTERVIEWEE, Well I think Madonna is great. She's been a wonderful friend and a very kind and supportive and amazing. And she'sshe's such an incredible woman. And you know I get compared to so many people. And we're compared to each other whether we're blond brunette black white straight gay. But on another level it's kind of funny because my mother actually looks sort of likelike Madonna. And the older I've gotten I look more and more like my mother. So sometimes I just want to say it's not my fault that I look like her.,INTERVIEWER, Did youdid you have fun doing that skit with her on "Saturday Night Live"?,INTERVIEWEE, I did. She is great. We had a blast. We were laughing. We're both quite militant about rehearsals. So we were driving everybody crazy rehearsing over and over and over again. And SNL wanted us to go get ready for the show and we kept going. But she is so great. And of course theno bad comparison to Madonna. She's wonderful. And there can never be another. So I have to think of even more ways to annoy and shock everyone because she's done everything.,INTERVIEWER, Oh. There will never be another you either. Let's go to some other areas. You were raised Catholic. You were raised as a Catholic. What are your feelings toward the church and religion in general?,INTERVIEWEE, Well I struggle. I struggle with my feelings about the church in particular. But I guess it's quite honestly completely separate isn't it? religion and the church are two completely separate things. But in terms of religion I'm very religious. I was raised Catholic. I believe in Jesus. I believe in God. I'm very spiritual. I pray very much. But at the same time there is no one religion that doesn't hate or speak against or be prejudiced against another racial group or religious group andor sexual group. For that I think religion is also bogus. So I suppose you could say I'm a quite religious woman that is very confused about religion. And I dream and envision a future where we have a more peaceful religion or a more peaceful world a more peaceful state of mind for the younger generation. And that's what I dream for.,INTERVIEWER, Do you believe you will go somewhere when you pass on?,INTERVIEWEE, Do I believe in heaven?,INTERVIEWER, Yes.,INTERVIEWEE, Or hell? I believe I will go to heaven but I suppose could go either way couldn't I?,INTERVIEWER, You mentioned earlier about this appeal to the gays. You're an outspoken advocate of gay rights. Why do you think there's such an appeal between you and the gay community? You for them they for you; why?,INTERVIEWEE, Well I can speak for myself. My admiration for the gay community comes from an incredibly steadfast and joyful courage and very bravery that they have for one another for their community. Toto be gay and to live openly in this society is something that requires a tremendous amount of strength and steadfastness. And I admire that. And I envy it in so many ways because it is something that I as a woman do not always wholeheartedly possess. And I think that my connection to them has actually been just symbiotic and mutual. Theythey know how much I love them. And my music in so many waysmy friends since I was very young were all gay. And they were always my closest friends my purest friendships. Gay men never wanted anything from but my life and my friendship. It wasit'sit's very different than the relationships with straight men. So I suppose it's just very pure. And I celebrate their culture and theirtheir union and who they are through in through in my music and in my fashion and in my work every day. And I will forever.,INTERVIEWER, It's out 25th Anniversary week. Tomorrow night Bill Gates. The president of the United States Thursday. And a major surprise Friday night. Lady Gaga is our big surprise tonight. What an honor to have her. What about Don't Ask Don't Tell. You think they're going to change it?,INTERVIEWEE, I hope so. You know there's so many things since Don't Ask Don't Tell. Recently I know they're working on repealing thethe restrictions on blood donors from the gay community. And its just there's so many archaic things floating around in the government right now that are so misinformed and so wrong. And Iit's very confusing. It's very confusing for young people especially you know 14 year olds in high school who are getting sent home because they have tea shirts that say "gay" on it as if "gay" is a curse word or somehow inappropriate. I just think that in terms of educationsexual education political education and social education schoolsI think it's important to be specific about civil rights and a person's worth. No person is worth any less than another human being based on their sexual orientation or religion.,INTERVIEWER, You said that your song "Poker Face" from "The Fame" is about your own bisexuality. Do youhow do you deal with that? Is thathow do you deal withare you with men more or women more? Do you want to be married? Whatwhat do you think?,INTERVIEWEE, I deal with it just fine. I'mI'm looking for love just like everyone else Larry. But right now love is in the form of my fans. Love comes in many different forms. Right now I'm passionately only serving them.,INTERVIEWER, Want to have children?, INTERVIEWEE, Yes some day. Although my womb is not yet beckoning for a child. I'mI'm very far away from that day. I'm also terrified it will ruin my creativity.,INTERVIEWER, We're back with our remaining moments with Lady Gaga. We decided since you were so much in honor of us we'll have a little in honor of you and go the sun glass route.,INTERVIEWEE, Oh Larry you are so shady.,INTERVIEWER, Look at this. You're adorable.,INTERVIEWEE, Shady King.,INTERVIEWER, You've got a number of Facebookwe've got a number of Facebook posts posted along the way. Ask Lady Gaga what her next albumwhen is it coming out and what will it be like?,INTERVIEWEE, Well my next albumit will not be coming out this Christmas which I don't know if I was supposed to tell you but I will tell you so my fans don't crucify me later. But I wanted to give it some time because even though it's finished I really want to give my fans what they deserve which is for me to promote and travel the world and give the new music to them in the most perfect and accessible way that I can. And I'm on tour right now which means I would have just had to throw the album up against the wall. And it just cheapens the atmosphere which I don't like to do. I like to do things that willI want to go kiss every D.J. and radio director around the world again like I did the first time. So that's the first thing. But the sound isI couldn't possibly give anything away because I don't want to reveal anything. But it'sthe album was inspired by my new found understanding and love for my fans aa new found love and understanding for what they need for what they dream about for what they dream for our generation and for the future. And the album for me is an anthem for the new decade. It's ,INTERVIEWER, Do ,INTERVIEWEE, Has an over-arching message.,INTERVIEWER, A couple quick things. ,INTERVIEWEE, I'm sorry?,INTERVIEWER, Do youI just want to see if I can still see. That was fun. Do youdo you enjoy fame?,INTERVIEWEE, Do I enjoy fame? I enjoy my fans. My fans are something I could never trade or even dream of giving up. But there are many things that come with it that I perhaps do not enjoy. You know at the end of the day I would much rather not go to the Hollywood party. I would much rather go to the pub around the corner and buy everyone a drink. So ,INTERVIEWER, Well ,INTERVIEWEE, So I just still do. And I can buy you a drink when I come see you in New York.,INTERVIEWER, You've got it. Let's get together soon OK?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes. We will. We will.,INTERVIEWER, The King and the lady.,INTERVIEWEE, The King and the lady. That sounds like a movie.,INTERVIEWER, What a special edition of larry king live we have for you tonight. It's the eve of our 25th anniversary.,INTERVIEWEE, Wow.,INTERVIEWER, Because we started backyes 25 years ago the longest running show. It feels like forever.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, And who's here with us but Mick Jagger.,INTERVIEWEE, Hi there.,INTERVIEWER, One of our top requests of all time. He's finally made it. Today is the day of the release of the Stones' album "Exile on Main Street." Never-before-heard tracks. This is an amazing release. At the same time it coincides with an amazing documentary called "Stones in Exile." We're going to talk about all those things and show you some little clips. This is a big re-release. But first ,INTERVIEWEE, Big. Yes.,INTERVIEWER, Frank Sinatra said to me once. There's a lot to be said for longevity. ,INTERVIEWEE, Well you've got no options really.,INTERVIEWER, That's right.,INTERVIEWEE, Either you're dead or you're longevity.,INTERVIEWER, How do you account for the longevity of the Stones as a success?,INTERVIEWEE, Well I think the Stones are very lucky. You always need a lot of luck. And I think they were in the right place at the right time. And weyou know quite when we work we work very hard. So I thinkso you need all those things. You know there's no good just being hard-working because lots of people are hard-working. But you've got to be hard-working on your game and be lucky.,INTERVIEWER, How about staying there though?,INTERVIEWEE, Staying there yes. Well it requires a certain you know tactics. It's likeit's like being a football player or something you know. If you're going to beif you're going to last you've got to play you know a bit clever. You know when you're young you can just rush everything. And then as you get older you've got to be a bit morebox a bit more clever. And I'm changing my sporting metaphors. Speakingyou know what I mean so ,INTERVIEWER, A lot goes into it?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes a lot. Yes a lot goes into it. And you know if you're going to do a tour or something that's a lot of work. And you know you have to beyou have to pay attention to the big picture the big picture has to be right. You know the overall has to be right and also the details have to be right.,INTERVIEWER, But don't eliminate the word luck.,INTERVIEWEE, No I'm not eliminating luck. There's a very bigbecause we all know everyone that's been inyou know whatever way of life you know oryou're in you know if you get to be very successful there is usually some point where you just happen to be lucky you know.,INTERVIEWER, Right place.,INTERVIEWEE, That tips it right over into being kind of OK and quite successful into tipping over into beinginto another point you know. ,INTERVIEWER, And how do you keep it up all the time? In other words when you get on that stage what keeps it going? What drives ,INTERVIEWEE, What really keeps it going is the audience. Because if theyou know you feed from the audience and their enthusiasm. And if you have an enthusiastic audience you feel that you know you can give more. You know so I can getI guess it's going back to the sporting metaphor. Any guyswhen you feel young you feel reallyyou feel like you have a bad day. And you feel you got a bit of a cold but as soon as you go out there ,INTERVIEWER, They drive you.,INTERVIEWEE, They drive you you know and you usually don't have any problems.,INTERVIEWER, But when you started you didn't have the audience because you were new.,INTERVIEWEE, No that's wellwe had our little audience. You know when we started off playing we were used to playing you know everyone else. We used to play ,INTERVIEWER, Clubs?,INTERVIEWEE, Small clubs. But we had a super enthusiastic club audience. And that kind ofthat audience really taught us how to behave how to have you know reparte with the audience and soand even from those early days it's not really than different to the exchange you get with the big audience.,INTERVIEWER, Now let's get into this album "Exile on Main Street." Whatthe decision to rerelease now.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, How did that come about?,INTERVIEWEE, Well wethere is a record label that bought all our catalog stuff called Universal Records. And they wanted to do something a bit different to mark this you know to put out these albums again. So they picked "Exile" as being one of the most famous. And they said well will you kind of do somethingyou know will you try and find time to re-master it and also is there any tracks that you didn't release at the time and can you do something special? And I said no there is no tracks there is nothing. It's all done you know. It was a double album. There's nothing there. But then I went in and I thought well I don't know. No I really don't know if there is anything. So I went in and Keith and I looked andI looked and Dom was our producer and we looked at all these tracks. And some of them were sent by people that thought they were like Stones experts. And I looked at them I said this doesn't sound like "Exile." Some of them were not in the time of "Exile" at all. So I just sort of define the time of what I thought "Exile" was. Because "Exile" wasn't recorded in a month. It was recorder over a three-year period. So I took this three-year period and found tracks that were recorded in that three-year period. And some of them the alternate takes which I left as they are and some tracks didn't have any songs them any vocals so ,INTERVIEWER, And nothing new?,INTERVIEWEE, New in what way?,INTERVIEWER, New recording for the album?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes I mean I didsome of them had no vocals on them.,INTERVIEWER, Oh you added vocals?,INTERVIEWEE, They had no song no vocals no words no music just tracks which were really good. Some of the tracks were all done and perfect. Except I wasn't on them. So I thought well OK so I'm going to do mine. So I wrote words and I wrote melodies and sang them on some.,INTERVIEWER, Are you a perfectionist?,INTERVIEWEE, Maybe. I am in some things. I mean always know there is only so far you can go you know in this kind of endeavor. You know you got toit's good you haveI like a deadline because then after the deadline you know you're done. And that's ,INTERVIEWER, Got to be there.,INTERVIEWEE, You got to be there. And you know because you can mess with this stuff. And some people in you know all kinds of artistic endeavors you know writing books or making movies or records that people love the process of it. They love the process of being in the studio or editing the movie. And so someone at some point says I think you're done now. I think you're finished. What you've got is good enough.,INTERVIEWER, Let's talk about the exile. You had a tax lien. You know people forget this story.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes it's not particularly interesting except to us.,INTERVIEWER, When a major group leaves?,INTERVIEWEE, Well yes where we had to go which is sort ofwe had some problems that wewe had some very bad advice. And we were you know pretty green in some ways. And we were just interested in making music and we weren't really interested in the money side of things too much. A very typical story.,INTERVIEWER, That wasn't the goal?,INTERVIEWEE, Money wasn't the goal. We expected to be well-off you know because in those days you just did if you were successful. And we're very successful but we weren't very well managed. So we had to leave England to acquire enough money to pay the taxes. Because in those days in England the high tax rate was 90 percent soThat's very hard.,INTERVIEWER, You made 100 pounds they took 90?,INTERVIEWEE, Exactly. You made 100 pounds they took 90. So it was very difficult to pay any debts back. So when we left the country we would get more than the 10 pounds out of the 100. We might get 50 or something.,INTERVIEWER, What was it like to live in France? The documentary shows it.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes. The documentary it wasyou know France is a niceyou know I knew France quite well. And you know most English people have been to France when they're kids. You know it's like the next-door country. And most English people have got experience of France. And then the south of France is pretty ,INTERVIEWER, Not bad?,INTERVIEWEE, Not bad. You know most people love it. You know and Somerset Maugham said you knowhas a saying it's a sunny place for shady people. So you know it has an underbelly you know as well. As well as the exotic glamorous exterior. But it wasn'tyes it's a good place. Beautiful climate.,INTERVIEWER, Wasn't it hard thoughwasn't it hard to leave home?,INTERVIEWEE, It's hard yes. I think at the beginning when you're young it's not you know. It's not really. I didn't find it much of a wrench. But then after a while you know you realize that you know I mean I didn't miss the British food and all that. But some English people miss other things. But after a while you realize that youit makes you a bit rootless or something and ,INTERVIEWER, Ruthless?,INTERVIEWEE, Rootless.,INTERVIEWER, Yes rootless. Yes.,INTERVIEWEE, Rootless. Yes. But you know having said that if you're a touring musician you tendthat's where you tend to be.,INTERVIEWER, The road?,INTERVIEWEE, It'sthe road is your life. And so it's notin a way you know you can overplay that.,INTERVIEWER, Were you held in low regard in your mother country for leaving it?,INTERVIEWEE, Oh probably everyone is. I mean everybody thatI mean you're already held in low regard in most countries if you even step out of it ever. You know what people want you to be is a little band that plays in clubs and that's where you should belong. They don't want you to be a big success. You're never the same. So especially in England in those days. And even now I think that youonce you become a success a worldwide success you no longer belong to the little place where you started to the little part of west London where you were brought up. Soor played. And so you lose something of that when you become a success. I don't think America's really like that. I think you find that kind of hard to understand.,INTERVIEWER, Yes. Success is resented?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes. It's resented. It was then anyway. I'm not sure about now whether it really is on the same level. England is a much more open place.,INTERVIEWER, You only had one law problem right? A marijuana thing that you weren't convicted. Right? You were never convicted?,INTERVIEWEE, I think I was. It was a long time ago. I think I wasevery time I come to the United States I still have to sort of go to the special place.,INTERVIEWER, Really?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes yes even though it's 40-something years ago. The marijuana conviction yes.,INTERVIEWER, Really?,INTERVIEWEE, I have to go into a room.,INTERVIEWER, You have to report?,INTERVIEWEE, Well you goyou can't go throughyou know the immigration line?,INTERVIEWER, Yes.,INTERVIEWEE, So sometimes if there is someone that knows something about how to deal with it they can do it. But normally I have to go to a special room.,INTERVIEWER, Lenny Bruce once said it will be legal some day because every law student I know smokes it.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes. That never happened.,INTERVIEWER, No.,INTERVIEWEE, Well it sort of half-happened doesn't it in the ,INTERVIEWER, Should it be legal?,INTERVIEWEE, You know it's legal to grow.,INTERVIEWER, Do you think it should?,INTERVIEWEE, Well the whole question of legalizing drugs is fraught withsomeone asked me this the other day. And I said you know theI don't know if I got into trouble so maybe I think but you know you usually try these things out in very small places. You know like so you try this inyou know like you try a new product out you know in a small kind of society or an island somewhere. And in England they always try out new mobile phones in isle of man. They've got a captive society. So I said you should tryyou should try the legalization of all drugs on the isle of man and see what happens.,INTERVIEWER, Do you think it will ever happen? Ever is a long time.,INTERVIEWEE, Ever is a long time. Peopleyou know there is certainly ahuman beings seem to have a propensity to want to take drugs in some form you know.,INTERVIEWER, Makes you feel good.,INTERVIEWEE, Thousands of years people have taken drugs whether it's alcohol which was invented about 5000 years ago. People have been using that. And all kinds of marijuana and all these things tobacco. I don't know how many thousands of years. A long time I'm sure. And so all these drugs you know have beenit seems to be the propensity of human beings to want to use them. So you have toI think you have to take that as red you know. But then what do you do when it affects so many people's lives and not in a good way you know. And then also then you get a lot of violence at both ends of the scope. So you get violence in some countries producing country violence. And then you getwhich like we have in Mexico now and you get violence at the other end of people trying to obtain drugs. So you've got that part of it isthat's the part that speaks to some sort of legalization. Because that you would hope would help the violence from both ends of the supply line.,INTERVIEWER, When it was in the group and it was famously reported about Keith Richards and the like did it ever affect your performance?,INTERVIEWEE, Probably.,INTERVIEWER, You don't remember?,INTERVIEWEE, No butno but you don'tI don'tpersonally you know like performing taking drugs. I always think it's better to be not taking drugs or drinking or anything. That's not saying I've never done it because I have. But I sort of learned I think after a while there has beenit didn't take me that long to realize that it wasn't a good thing. You know taking drugs on a recreation level is one thing. But taking them while you're working on a stage is you know I don't think it was that great.,INTERVIEWER, A control?,INTERVIEWEE, It's the control factor. And the thing about being on stage you really want to feel that you're sort of in control a lot I think because I don't think you wantit's not a place where you want to be out of control.,INTERVIEWER, Back to the album.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, You recorded overand you recorded in weird places right?,INTERVIEWEE, Well not so much. No. We got ,INTERVIEWER, Downstairs.,INTERVIEWEE, In the basement in this house that Keith rented in the south of France.,INTERVIEWER, What was that like?,INTERVIEWEE, A lot of it wasit was ayou know it was wonderful. No it was a collection of Warren-like basement rooms you know like a ,INTERVIEWER, How could you get good acoustics?,INTERVIEWEE, Well it wasn't very good acoustics. We spent a long while getting that right. Once we got it right it was good. The beginning was ,INTERVIEWER, Why not a studio?,INTERVIEWEE, In the south of France where we were there weren't any studios.,INTERVIEWER, So you had ,INTERVIEWEE, We had to create a studio. We've done recording like this before. We had our own recording truck. We had you know like a mobile recording truck. And we'd recorded before in this fashion. So it wasn't really that much of a stretch. But there was problems you know. It was damp and it was ,INTERVIEWER, Isn't three years a long time?,INTERVIEWEE, We weren't there for three years. We're only there for like six seven months..,INTERVIEWER, With modern techniques now it's incredible what you can do right?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes would bewouldn't bewouldn't need a truck. And thenso that you know how we did it now is we just have a board and a room and you wouldn't need so much ,INTERVIEWER, How is the sound on the re-release? INTERVIEWEE, Well I just remastered the old tracks. So they sound very similar to what they sounded before. And the new tracks I think when we mix them weyou know we mix them with the same kind of spirit. And so they sound very much part of theof the new tunes you put in.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, Can you describeand you're very good at thiswhat it is like to hear a piece or read a piece of music and say yes?,INTERVIEWEE, That's a good feeling when it all comes together. You know so there was a trackthere is a track on this called "Following the River" which is a ballad. It has got a beautiful piano part in it which I didn't play. And I had heard this before but it didn't have any lyrics on it at all. And it had a beautifulI could hear different melodies but I didn't know how I was going to get the melody to fit with this already-existing track which is very heavily piano. And when it came together when I sort ofI was just singing along to it. I put it on stereo and I was singing along trying to come up with melody lines and trying different stuff different words. And when it actually came together it was a very good moment you know? It's ,INTERVIEWER, There is a moment.,INTERVIEWEE, There is a moment. And you gothere is a build-up of this you know and then try try try try and then there's a moment where it really comes together for you.,INTERVIEWER, When you watch this documentary which as I told you before we went on is extraordinary in that it's not like any other documentaryit's going toit comes in DVD right?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes it's going to be a DVD coming out in June I think.,INTERVIEWER, When you watch it is ithow do you react to watching it? Because it's very unusually done. There is no narrator.,INTERVIEWEE, There is nono there is no narrator. When we started off talking about this with the director and I said thatand I discussed it with him and he you know totally into the same thinghe goes I wanted thatthe audience to feel that they were in 1972. I didn't want them to feel that it was me and Keith sitting in armchairs and sayingyou know showing the guitars that they were played on. And I've seen many of these kind of documentaries. They sort of have a formula. So I said well I want the viewer to feel that he's there he or she is in that time frame as much as possible. So we usedin the end it must be 90 percent of footage from the time and a tiny bit from now. And the way it sort ofthose two things fit together I think makes it forI mean you don'tyou do kind of get the vibe of the time.,INTERVIEWER, It's great to have both come out the documentary and the album come out.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes. Yes yes.,INTERVIEWER, How did you pick the name?,INTERVIEWEE, How did we pick the name? God that's lost in the mists of time. It was from a famous blues song by Muddy Waters called "Rolling Stone Blues." Muddy Waters was one of our great heroes.,INTERVIEWER, Oh I'm sure.,INTERVIEWEE, And a famous blues singer. And we used to do some of his songs and everything. And so we took the name from him.,INTERVIEWER, Did critics pan this album initially?,INTERVIEWEE, I don't think they panned it no. I think it got sort of mixed reviews.,INTERVIEWER, How do you react to reviews?,INTERVIEWEE, Well ,INTERVIEWER, I mean when you're this famous does it matter?,INTERVIEWEE, I think it does matter. I mean I think see there are some reviewers that you kind of respect to some extent. You know there are some reviewers that just write rubbish and you know you can discount them. But then you want theyou kind of wantwhen you put out a piece of work you want to have the approval ofyou want your own self-approval first. You want to feel that ,INTERVIEWER, You like it.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes. I'd like it. And the rest of the musicians band whatever you have to like it. Everyone has to like it. And then your friends have to like it. You know you play it to your friends first. You know you play it. And your peer group has to like it. And you want themyou want their peer group approval. I mean yes you can always say ah well I don't care if he doesn't like it. But you wantand then you wantyou want the public to like it and you want the critics to like it. You want everyone to like it. So it can work on many levels. You know so you can be very happy with the album but no one else likes it. It's notthat's a success but it's a big success if you get all of those groups liking it. And somethingyou can't have all of those things happen but youso of course everyone wants critical approval. You can't get 100 percent. There are alwaysevery critic is going to say...,INTERVIEWER, Have you ever had a critic ,INTERVIEWEE,bad things about you.,INTERVIEWER, Ever have a critic help you? Did you ever have a critic write something where you say you know good point?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes I mean I think sometimes inyou know they do have points you know that theyI mean sometimes. And it's very subjective. It's what he wants to hear isn't it? Or she would have liked it to sound like...,INTERVIEWER, It's very subjective.,INTERVIEWEE, You know it's very subjective. So they wanted to hear something rougher or they want to hear something smoother or they want to hear more sort of smoochy or they want to hear somewhatever more danceable. So it's all very subjective. But I mean you wantyou know they're going to say it's really going toon one hand it's really good but on another hand it isn't. You know they always say that critics really. They can't love it or ,INTERVIEWER, What groups or individuals affected you as a youngster? Did someone have an impact?,INTERVIEWEE, Lots of people had impact. You know living in England it wasn't quite as easy to assimilate the kind of music that I loved.,INTERVIEWER, Were there American stars you ,INTERVIEWEE, There were American stars that would visit occasionally. You know and you'd have to really be on the ball to know when they were coming and so on or youand there was no Internet to you know find out and so on. And you'd have to ,INTERVIEWER, Who did you like?,INTERVIEWEE, I likedwell one of the early visitors a lot to England was called Big Bill Broonzy and he was a blues singer with a kind of veryyou know he used to play a 12-string as well. There was Leadbelly who used to visit. They used to play on the TVon nationwide TV. So that was kind ofyou know something you probably didn't see in America very often.,INTERVIEWER, Did the guitarists have a great effect on you?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes. Those guitarists you know Muddy Waters had a big effect more rock people more like Little Richard and some Buddy Holly. Elvis of course was ,INTERVIEWER, What was Buddy Holly's...,INTERVIEWEE, Buddy Holly was very popular with all of theseevery English person you talked to from my generation at least would always tell you that Buddy Holly was a bighe was a big influence as a songwriter I think because he wrotewhen he was ,INTERVIEWER, Melodically.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes melodically. And he wrote all of these songs in a very short period of time. And they're all very simple. They'reall the chord structures ,INTERVIEWER, Very.,INTERVIEWEE,are very simple. There's nothing.,INTERVIEWER, "Peggy Sue.",INTERVIEWEE, Yes all of these things. And he was very big in England. And I think he toured only once. I saw him on stage. But he was a very big influence. I mean Paul McCartney bought the catalog,INTERVIEWER, Were the Beatles rivals? How did you view them?,INTERVIEWEE, They were both rivals and they were alsohow do youwhat was a good word to choose? I mean they were also showing the way because they were the first of this kind of ,INTERVIEWER, So you kind of admired them?,INTERVIEWEE, Admired them for that because they were sort of trailblazers in a lot of ways. And you know they went to the United States first. You know they showed the way. They were big international stars. They showedbecause in England most English people have never really been stars outside of England. It would be that you had your little patch and that was it. And the Beatles kind of showed that you could be big internationally.,INTERVIEWER, What's Jimmy Fallon got to do with Mick Jagger? A lot. Watch this.,INTERVIEWEE, What else you got? Well pointing fingers pointing fingers.,INTERVIEWER, Explain that.,INTERVIEWEE, Jimmy Fallon ,INTERVIEWER, Explain it to a logical person.,INTERVIEWEE, Well what you mean with what we're doing?,INTERVIEWER, He does you right?,INTERVIEWEE, Oh he does me? Well lots of people do me. Jimmy does his version of me which of course is nothing like me. But Jimmy does a funny version of me. We've done a couple of sketches on "Saturday Night Live" together. And Jimmy this week is doing a week of "Exile on Main Street." And at the end of the week on Friday they're going to show part of the documentary film that we were talking about earlier.,INTERVIEWER, Do you ever have the feeling of when you make it that tonight will be easy? I mean we're the Stones.,INTERVIEWEE, No no no. You never think that. You know that. You never thinkthere is never tonight is going to be easy.,INTERVIEWER, Never?,INTERVIEWEE, No no. No.,INTERVIEWER, He told me he got that right before he went on stage there was that little bump you know am I going to have it tonight? Is it going to work tonight?,INTERVIEWEE, I don't really feel like that. But you just feel like you're going to go out and slay them basically. You know that's how I feel. OK you know you say OK I'm going to go out and kill the audience and this is it.,INTERVIEWER, But you don't feel you have it made?,INTERVIEWEE, No no no. No that's dangerous. You don't ever feel that you've got it made. You know you can hear if the audience is very enthusiastic very loud super noisy you know you've gotyou know well they seem to be on our side as something you know they sound awfully quiet you know. You know I have to work this you know youyou know what I mean?,INTERVIEWER, Yes. ,INTERVIEWEE, And it's always good to go andit's always to go and look at the audience while the opening act is on too.,INTERVIEWER, On this album...,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, Where do you rank it among all of your works?,INTERVIEWEE, Oh my goodness. I don't know really. It's one of the real good ones. And it's a real favorite of people. And we do play a lot on stage of this album. So you know I rank it right up there.,INTERVIEWER, Special?,INTERVIEWEE, A special album for me.,INTERVIEWER, And thehow many additional tunes have been added?,INTERVIEWEE, Eleven. Some of them are alternate takes but there are six that haven't been released before yes. I think they're all good. Of course I do.,INTERVIEWER, When do you tour again?,INTERVIEWEE, I don't know yet. But I look forward to doing it.,INTERVIEWER, Is it always worldwide?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, Thanks Mick.,INTERVIEWEE, Hey thank you so much.,INTERVIEWER, Good evening. Mike Tyson returns to larry king live the legendary former heavyweight boxing champion always welcome around here. How are you doing?,INTERVIEWEE, I'm doing awesome. Thanks my friend.,INTERVIEWER, We have been together many many times over the years. Do you ever look back and say I'm not the guy that I was?,INTERVIEWEE, All the time all the time. Yeah. It's pretty interesting that you said that. I look at that guy and say what was going on? Who was happening there? You have no idea what was going on with my life back then with this guy. What was going on back then?,INTERVIEWER, What the most changed you?,INTERVIEWEE, I don't know. I had to grow up. I had an incident where I lost my daughter in some family accident at home and it was just a time to grow up and wake up.,INTERVIEWER, That was of course the worst incident in your life right?,INTERVIEWEE, Pretty much pretty much. Yeah.,INTERVIEWER, She died how?,INTERVIEWEE, A freak accident on the treadmill.,INTERVIEWER, How old was she?,INTERVIEWEE, Four.,INTERVIEWER, Were you home?,INTERVIEWEE, No. I wasn't living with her mother at the time. I was in Las Vegas and they lived in Phoenix. And her mother called me and told me what happened. I rushed down there and it was already pretty much a done deal.,INTERVIEWER, How do youyou never get over that do you?,INTERVIEWEE, I don't know. I don't know. It's a new stage. It's the beginning stage. So I don't know if I get over it or not.,INTERVIEWER, Do you believe in an afterlife? Do you believe that she is somewhere?,INTERVIEWEE, I don't know anything. I just know that we have to keep on living and being alive is for the living and being dead is for the dying. We have to continue living you know.,INTERVIEWER, That's an interesting philosophy on life. You are done with boxing right?,INTERVIEWEE, Pretty much yeah.,INTERVIEWER, You don't ever think about doing a Holyfield?,INTERVIEWEE, Never ever. I wish I couldI'm envious that he does it but I wish I could.,INTERVIEWER, Do you ever miss it?,INTERVIEWEE, Periodically. Not I should have done this but every now and then.,INTERVIEWER, You don't go through would have should have could have?,INTERVIEWEE, Never.,INTERVIEWER, The career the life and times of Mike Tyson an extraordinary figure in the history of American sport the former heavyweight boxing champion. Let's go back a little. Do you think you had too much too soon?,INTERVIEWEE, I don't know Larry. I wanted it I don't know if I was prepared for it but I know I wanted it. I was prepared to get it. I trained hard and worked hard you know.,INTERVIEWER, How old were you when you were a champion?,INTERVIEWEE, 20-years-old.,INTERVIEWER, In reflection would you have been better off if it had happened when you were 25?,INTERVIEWEE, No because then I would have been obsolete. I would have just been like everyone else.,INTERVIEWER, So you're glad that you're the youngest person to hold the title?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, You grew up in a tough neighborhood in Brooklyn.,INTERVIEWEE, You did too.,INTERVIEWER, Same neighborhood Brownsville.,INTERVIEWEE, Isn't that an awesome place?,INTERVIEWER, Saratoga Park did you used to go there?,INTERVIEWEE, All the time.,INTERVIEWER, My dad used to take me there for Good Humor ice cream. You had to bust out of that neighborhood?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes of course you know it was a tough inner city probably the toughest in America the poorest city in America. And it's just a world of dog eat dog. Of course it's where Murder Incorporated originated from.,INTERVIEWER, You know your history.,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah.,INTERVIEWER, You have Brooklyn still in you though?,INTERVIEWEE, Until the day I die yes.,INTERVIEWER, Me too.,INTERVIEWEE, It's just who you are. There's something about Brooklyn people and it's interesting because every one of us always feel different. For some reason if we feel like we're from Brooklyn we will like we're the best. Don't you feel the same way too?,INTERVIEWER, Not the best. Certainly we're apart.,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah. People are going to know our name and know where we came from. You feel the same way too.,INTERVIEWER, Yeah. A lot of success stories out of Brooklyn.,INTERVIEWEE, Exactly 100 percent.,INTERVIEWER, Maybe it's because we're like an island. Manhattan was out there right?,INTERVIEWEE, I would say so yeah.,INTERVIEWER, Do you still have friends from Brooklyn?,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah I do. And you know it's going to be interesting because this new documentary series that I'm a part of into the world of pigeon flying and bird racing so you're going to see some of my friends that I grew up when I was a little kid and we grew up flying pigeons together when we were 10 and 11-years-old and we're still flying pigeons now. So it's ironic how we interact it's not the Mike Tyson that you're used to seeing. It's not like Mike Tyson and his entourage it's like get that f'ing bird get this watch out move down. It's just really interesting.,INTERVIEWER, I remember Brando flew pigeons in a movie.,INTERVIEWEE, On the waterfront.,INTERVIEWER, He flew pigeons. What took you to flying pigeons?,INTERVIEWEE, I don't know. It's someI was probably 10 or 11- years-old. And I was flying some birdssome friends of mine had skipped school and I had skipped school too because some guys were picking on me all the time so I didn't want to go to school. So these other guys saw me and said come here. You have any money? I was a frightened and scared kid and they packed my pocket and they said you want to fly with us? I didn't know what fly meant. I said yeah I'm a dope. So they made me climb the fence and I had to get those crate boxes you know in the school they had those crate boxes so I threw a few of the crate boxes over and we went to this abandoned building at St. Marks all right. And we went there and I'm getting creeped out like why are we in this building with these guys? This is little kids they're older than me. And we go on the roof and I see a little coup raggedy coup and I see some pigeons and I'm like wow. And so these birds that these guys had they were really ill conditioned birds. They were horrible birds. They couldn't fly 100 feet but every time they would fly they would land on the building so these guys would make me a gopher they would make me chasego on the abandoned building chase the birds off that building say go to another building and go to a corporate building and I had to go to a building.,INTERVIEWER, They didn't fly back?,INTERVIEWEE, No. They were just so lazy. They had rotten birds.,INTERVIEWER, So you got to like it?,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah.,INTERVIEWER, Why?,INTERVIEWEE, I don't know. I really wish I could tell you. It's like ,INTERVIEWER, Do you have birds now?,INTERVIEWEE, Birds in my house. Well all together I have birds everywhere that I journey I have homes that I live hang out I have birds there. So all together I have probably around 2500 birds.,INTERVIEWER, OK Mike you don't think that's a little weird?,INTERVIEWEE, Well in different places. I don't know. It's always a problem.,INTERVIEWER, When you have pigeons do they fly and come back to you?,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah.,INTERVIEWER, Are they like trained?,INTERVIEWEE, Sometimes they fly 500 miles you take them 500 miles and they come back. That's just the pigeon world. It's very difficult to explain to a person.,INTERVIEWER, There's so many inconsistencies in you Mike. I guess you wonder about it yourself. You find Allah. At the same time you get yourself in trouble over the years you've got trouble with drugs with the law with the paparazzi financial problems. Are there two Mike Tysons?,INTERVIEWEE, I don't know if there's two Mike Tysons but everyone knows who cares who you are the richest person in the world the poorest person in the world hard times fall upon everyone. And regardless of what kind of religion you could be a Christian a Muslim a Jew atheist whatever you are whoever we are whatever we have with us we bring our baggage to us to our religion with us regardless of who we are we just have baggage that we have and we bring it with us. And until we work on the problem that is an inside job we're going to still be reckless and continue to get into a lot of trouble.,INTERVIEWER, Shouldn't your faith have helped you not get in trouble?,INTERVIEWEE, I don't know. I don't know if faith can help me. I have to help me. I have to help me. You know what I mean? God don't help anyone that doesn't help themselves. So I have to help me.,INTERVIEWER, Do you remember what attracted you or maybe this is hardest thing to explain to drugs in the first place? I know you defeated it.,INTERVIEWEE, I like to believe that because I was born an addict. My mother was an addict. So I am who I am. I love who I am and embrace who I am. And that's just who it is.,INTERVIEWER, Were you addicted when you were boxing? ,INTERVIEWEE, I've always been addicted. I've always been addicted. I wasn't using drugs when I was boxing when I started. But it was so interesting. And then I said why I didn't do drugs for 14 years but I never considered alcohol is a drug too. But I would get drunk after every fight. I said I'm off drugs 14 years but really I wasn't. So that wasn't really true. I was just lying to myself. I would get drunk after every fight just blasted.,INTERVIEWER, Do you still consider yourself an addict?,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah.,INTERVIEWER, How long sober?,INTERVIEWEE, Probably 18 months.,INTERVIEWER, See if you were born an addict your mother an addict that can happen at birth.,INTERVIEWEE, I don't use that for no excuse because if I used that for an excuse there's no way could I ever accomplish what I've accomplished you know. You can't help who you are what you are but you can sure help your conduct.,INTERVIEWER, How do you avoid temptation?,INTERVIEWEE, I have responsibilities in my life. I don't want to let my children down anymore. I don't want to let myself down I don't want to let my wife down anymore. And I have a lot of things to do in a very short time.,INTERVIEWER, I guess the former heavyweight champion and one of myhe's aMike Tyson he's an unusual guy. He has a new show coming out next year on "Animal Planet.",INTERVIEWEE, Thank you very much Larry.,INTERVIEWER, It's calledI don't want to offend you.,INTERVIEWEE, Never.,INTERVIEWER, Who is with you?,INTERVIEWEE, That's my friend Mario. He also is one of the co-hosts on the show that we're having.,INTERVIEWER, Do we see pigeons flying in that show?,INTERVIEWEE, Absolutely.,INTERVIEWER, When you have a pigeon race do they have numbers on them?,INTERVIEWEE, Of course. They have bands and you have the bands identify them and everyone gets their team of birds maybe 30 guys 100 guysit depends.,INTERVIEWER, Where do they race?,INTERVIEWEE, It depends on the duration let's take them 1000 miles let's them 100 miles let's take them 70 miles it depends.,INTERVIEWER, Wait a minute. OK they're going to race 100. Do they race from L.A. to Vegas?,INTERVIEWEE, I'm sure yes.,INTERVIEWER, How do you know who won?,INTERVIEWEE, As soon as they come back the bird gets in you clock the time. You clock the time it gets in and you can't cheat because the time is on the computer and then we all wait until ,INTERVIEWER, How fast do they fly?,INTERVIEWEE, Sixty miles-an-hour.,INTERVIEWER, Whoa. That's pretty fast. You can't make money from this?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes you can this is big money. ,INTERVIEWER, How?,INTERVIEWEE, But we're not doing it for money. We're doing it for bragging rights.,INTERVIEWER, How do you make money from pigeon racing?,INTERVIEWEE, It's one of the biggest sports in the world yes everyone does that.,INTERVIEWER, Are you betting each other?,INTERVIEWEE, Different clubs bet each other.,INTERVIEWER, This was a new world to me.,INTERVIEWEE, No this was before Christ.,INTERVIEWER, Do you name your pigeons?,INTERVIEWEE, No.,INTERVIEWER, I know you had a bad temper. I remember that phase of you. Do you still have it?,INTERVIEWEE, Well not really but I'm sure you can get it out if you look deep enough.,INTERVIEWER, I mean do little things set you off?,INTERVIEWEE, Not as much as they used to no. How about you?,INTERVIEWER, No I'll get it but it goes right away. I've never held a grudge.,INTERVIEWEE, I wish I could say that.,INTERVIEWER, You hold grudges?,INTERVIEWEE, No I've held some I haven't had any to hold lately but I have held some before.,INTERVIEWER, When you were in the ring you wereI've had the good fortune of interviewing many many boxers many heavyweight champions. And Rocky Marciano told me he would have rather been a baseball player. He never really liked it. He was good at it but he never liked it and he didn't like the killer instinct. He had to have it. It was in the ring. But he never enjoyed it really enjoyed it. You enjoyed it didn't you?,INTERVIEWEE, Well you know it's funny you say that. In order to accomplish all of the goals that D'Amato put in front of me I had to view myself greater than what I truly was. So I had to really get into a character be this unstoppable invincible monster and that's just what it was.,INTERVIEWER, So was your manager D'Amato trainer D'Amato forcing you into that?,INTERVIEWEE, No but I wanted to make him happy. He was like my father figure. I wanted to make him happy I wanted to be the ferocious champion that was invincible.,INTERVIEWER, What was it like to hit someone hard?,INTERVIEWEE, You know Larry when you're fighting actually in the ring in the ring you're talking about right?,INTERVIEWER, Yeah for you it could be anywhere but I'm talking about in the ring.,INTERVIEWEE, I don't know. You practice it most of your life and then you accomplish it in the ring and you work for it. You anticipated it you expected it. You don't get a big joy out of it. You expect it to happen. If it doesn't happen then you have a disappointment moment.,INTERVIEWER, Do you ever feel sorry for an opponent?,INTERVIEWEE, I don't think so no. It was either him or me at that time. I could have all the admiration and respect for him but it's either me or him at that time.,INTERVIEWER, Ali told me once hey all of these poems and everything that guy is trying to hurt me.,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah but we can't look at it like this. This is a job. No one put a gun to our heads and made us do this. This is a job. head. It's more of an art. If you're doing your art correctly you're not going to get hurt.,INTERVIEWER, We're back with Mike Tyson. Do you still train? Do you keep in shape?,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah yeah I do basically two hours a day. So the treadmill or the bike hour on the treadmill hour on the bike may walk two hours. And that's all I do light weights.,INTERVIEWER, Do you go to fights?,INTERVIEWEE, Sometimes.,INTERVIEWER, Do you like watching boxing?,INTERVIEWEE, Sometimes sometimes.,INTERVIEWER, You're not a big fan?,INTERVIEWEE, I like being entertained. If it's MMA if it's boxing if it's a movie I just want to be to be entertained. I want somebody to entertain me because that's what I like to do. I like to entertain people so I want to be entertained too. So if I'm not being entertained I don't go. There's not too many entertaining fighters not too many entertaining heavyweights in the boxing world. They're good fighters just not entertaining. People get the two confused a guy being a confident fighter rather than being an exciting fighter.,INTERVIEWER, Ali.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, You were both.,INTERVIEWEE, Thank you.,INTERVIEWER, You could go on a quiz show with the subject of boxing. You know your history right?,INTERVIEWEE, At one time I did I knew a little bit yes.,INTERVIEWER, You used to name all the champions the years of the champions who beat who.,INTERVIEWEE, Because that was my profession. I wanted to be the best at it so I wanted to know the whole history of their stuff. I was just crazy about this boxing stuff.,INTERVIEWER, What do you remember most about that terrible night in Tokyo where Buster Douglas beat you biggest upset of all that night?,INTERVIEWEE, I don't know. I just remember he fought good that night. He really fought good.,INTERVIEWER, You weren't trained well?,INTERVIEWEE, Well I could have been better trained but the fact is he fought great. That really set off everything.,INTERVIEWER, Did you know early on you were in trouble?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes yes I did.,INTERVIEWER, What told you?,INTERVIEWEE, When I couldn't hit him.,INTERVIEWER, That must have been a pretty good sign frustrating. Most of the guys that you fought were taller than you right?,INTERVIEWEE, Pretty much yes.,INTERVIEWER, People didn't realize that.,INTERVIEWEE, I'm pretty short I'm 5'10." I'm not a tall person.,INTERVIEWER, Yes but these guyswould you have liked to have fought Ali?, INTERVIEWEE, No no I don't want to fight Ali. That's one of my heroes. I wouldn't want to fight those guys. I like the way history made all of these guys I watched before me Dempsey Ali Tunney.,INTERVIEWER, Lewis?,INTERVIEWEE, Lewis yes. Marciano. I just watched those guys and I said man I'm glad that I watched them before me you know I mean because if I didn't have those guys to watch and study there's no way I would have been successful in this stuff.,INTERVIEWER, When you see Muhammad Ali now and you see what the disease has done to him do you ever fear of something slowing you down as you age?,INTERVIEWEE, I don't know. There's not much that I'm afraid of basically in life you know? Because when you think about it the worst thing that ever happened to me I lostI lost one of my kids. So what am I afraid of?,INTERVIEWER, You can't top that no.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes tell me about it. So no I don't think I'm afraid of anything.,INTERVIEWER, Why do you live in Las Vegas?,INTERVIEWEE, Because I've lived forI've lived for probably 24 years25 years. That's just so long.,INTERVIEWER, What do you like about it the most?,INTERVIEWEE, It's just who I am. It's where I'myou know what I mean? I know everybody there. It's justit's notlike my home now.,INTERVIEWER, Is it hot in the summer?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes I'm used to that stuff.,INTERVIEWER, A Brooklyn kid you know.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes but that's OK. I can handle it. That's a Brooklyn kid. We can endure anything.,INTERVIEWER, OK. All right. By the way do you think you deserve to be in the Boxing Hall of Fame?,INTERVIEWEE, I don't know. That's not up to me to decide you know? Let the people vote and decide whether I should be in the Hall of Fame or not you know?,INTERVIEWER, Do you think you should be?,INTERVIEWEE, I don't know. I can'tif I ever allow my will to run riot I'll sayI think I deserve to be a God but I won't because I will never say that. But I just think you know I can't say anything do I deserve anything because of course everybody in their own belief want to be the best in the world at what their endeavors were. That's what they want to be.,INTERVIEWER, I sat with you in the ring in Las Vegas the eve of your comeback fight. You just got out of prison. BoxingI asked you if it was a tough way to make a living. You didn't want to answer and then you said I don't want to be a harlot to this sport. I'm not going to say something against it. Do you still feel that way?,INTERVIEWEE, I don't know. I owe boxing a lot. So I don't really have nothing derogatory to say about it.,INTERVIEWER, Does it owe you anything?,INTERVIEWEE, Well I don't want anything from it.,INTERVIEWER, You made a lot of money from it?,INTERVIEWEE, Well that's great you know? But boxingI'm not bigger than boxing. You know what I mean? I wish I was. Not one individual fighter is bigger than boxing. You know what I mean?,INTERVIEWER, We are back with the legendary Mike Tyson. I asked the aforementioned Rocky Marciano once if he was ever afraid of anyone. And he said when he was a kid he was bullied and there was a bully on the block that he was afraid of. Did you ever have anybody you were afraid of?,INTERVIEWEE, I'm afraid of tons of people I guess.,INTERVIEWER, When you were a kid?,INTERVIEWEE, When I was a kid yes. You know it's easy to be bullied because you never fought before and you don't if you're going to win. You don't have the confidence you know? Confidence is everything. Confidence breeds success. Success breeds confidence. Without confidence you just don't go nowhere.,INTERVIEWER, Did you have fights as a kid?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes but I wasn't that successful. You know what I mean? They some of the stories make it like I was beating everybody up in the streets. No I wasn't that successful.,INTERVIEWER, Did kids beat you up?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes yes.,INTERVIEWER,after you won the championships sitting around with friends saying you know I beat him up once?,INTERVIEWEE, Wow.,INTERVIEWER, Do you ever run into some later on?,INTERVIEWEE, No never.,INTERVIEWER, You'd have a tough time. What do you make of all this bullying going on today?,INTERVIEWEE, I don't know. It's just a different world from when I was a little kid. It's a different world.,INTERVIEWER, I mean do you know why people bully people? I've never understood it.,INTERVIEWEE, I don't know. People bully people because they were bullied. That's just the way it goes. The abuser becomes the abusee. And that's just how it goes right?,INTERVIEWER, Yes but bullying people because they're gay or because they're different from you or because they're black.,INTERVIEWEE, Well I don't know. We don't know who we are. Some people don't understand themselves. How do we understandit's difficult to understand people in society now? People just don't want to get along. You ever think racism is at a all-time high. People ,INTERVIEWER, Well we got a black president.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes butall right. That's awesome. But you know people want to feel different. You know what I mean? We have a black president but people want to feel the change that he actuallythat we're fighting for.,INTERVIEWER, It's never going to end then. Or do you think it will? Do you think it will everno it will never end.,INTERVIEWEE, What?,INTERVIEWER, Racism.,INTERVIEWEE, I don't know. Everyone always has something to be P'd off about I guess.,INTERVIEWER, You got to feel better than somebody. You were trying to help a young boy with aplastic anemia.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, What is that? He's an eight-year-old kid. ,INTERVIEWEE, Yes and he continues to have thesehe's like my nephew in a way. You know me and his father me and his uncle are very tight. We're going to be on the pigeon show too. They're pigeon flyers with me.,INTERVIEWER, Do they live in Vegas?,INTERVIEWEE, No they live in Jersey City.,INTERVIEWER, So how did you meet the kid?,INTERVIEWEE, Well I knew himI knew his parents before he was born and we flew pigeons ever since we were all littlethey were little ,INTERVIEWER, All right. What is aplastic anemia?,INTERVIEWEE, It'sbasically what he needs is a bone marrow transplant. Yes he needs that because he has these horrific fevers that go over 105 every day. And there's no way he could stay homehave to stay in the hospital. He's an awesome little kid.,INTERVIEWER, So they need a match.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, Have people offered? Have people tried?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes we hadwe hadI believe a month ago we had a rally and we had like 600 people came out because it's very rare in the African-American and Spanish community that we get any donors.,INTERVIEWER, So you need a black donor right?,INTERVIEWEE, No he's a Puerto Rican child.,INTERVIEWER, Does he have to bewell probably has to be Latino then.,INTERVIEWEE, I don't understand. Well we just hope that somebody's a match.,INTERVIEWER, What if somebody's watching now and wants to offer to try.,INTERVIEWEE, Well I believe we gave the producers the number.,INTERVIEWER, Do you still feel that way?,INTERVIEWEE, No. I was a real mean guy Larry.,INTERVIEWER, Boy you were mean.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.

This is going to be something new on me to be totally committed and dedicated to this situation.,INTERVIEWER, Something I've meant to ask you ,INTERVIEWEE, What?, INTERVIEWER, Why did you put those markings on your face? Because I liked this. This is what I wanted to do. When I saw the tattoo I wanted to do it. But I just didn't find the right tattoo to do it with. Don'tdoesn't tattooing hurt?,INTERVIEWEE, Well Iyes it did hurt a little. Yes.,INTERVIEWER, It hurt a little?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, They'rethey're taking a needle right and they're rubbing it into your head. Why?,INTERVIEWEE, Because I want to Larry. Because I wanted the tattoo Larry. That's why I did it. Because I wanted the tattoo.,INTERVIEWER, Are you happy with them?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes pretty much. Yes.,INTERVIEWER, You like the look?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, Because you didn't need anything to tell people who you were. Do you think it scares people? Do you think it ,INTERVIEWEE, Well if it did I wouldn't be on this show.,INTERVIEWER, Who hit you the worst ever?,INTERVIEWEE, I don't know everyone.,INTERVIEWER, No but the worst ever ,INTERVIEWEE, And when they hit me you know please ,INTERVIEWER, But was it ever a punch thatwhoa?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes Ray Ruddock a couple of guys Holyfield. You're talking about when you were like whoa. When you get hit it doesn't hurt anymore. It's just numb. You just hear the bell ringingbong.,INTERVIEWER, Yes bong. It's not pain?,INTERVIEWEE, No. But of course you wouldn't know. If anybody had really been clockedof course Larry if someone got clocked well they'll tell you that youyou don't feel anything. It's not like oh you're in a lot of pain. When you get clocked really good and you really get knocked out you don'tyou don't feel a thing.,INTERVIEWER, You're just gone?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes. You don't feel anything.,INTERVIEWER, Thank you Mike.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes you're welcome Larry.,INTERVIEWER, You kept a diary and now you reveal it?,INTERVIEWEE, Well I thought I'd wait 30 years and do it.,INTERVIEWER, Why wait?,INTERVIEWEE, Well it was highly personal. When I wrote it I never thought I would let it be published. But I re-read it a few years ago and I saw that there were so many things that are pertinent today the same issues that I faced that Obama is having to face today. And also I thought it was good to have somewhere on the historical record just the actual day by day thoughts and dreams and ideas and failures and successes and impressions of other people that are still quite fresh in people's minds. So those are the main things I wanted to point out.INTERVIEWER, Were you before the presidency a diary keeper?,INTERVIEWEE, No I never did. As a matter of fact the first time I thought about doing a diary was when I was governor. And we went up to the White House to the governor's conference. And we met Richard Nixon who was the first president I ever met. He was standing there with Billy Graham. And Richard Nixon he kind of ignored me. And he reached over and shook my wife's hand and said young lady are you keeping a diary? She said no I don't. He said well you're a governor's wife and you ought to keep a diary. So we talked about it. So when I became president I decided well why don't I keep a diary? So it was really Richard Nixon who talked me into keeping a diary.,INTERVIEWER, What a great story. Did you just write it in pen?,INTERVIEWEE, No I dictated it. I had a small hand held Dictaphone. And so Iwhen I finished up a tape I just threw it in the out basket. I never looked at it again. I put a new tape in. And six or seven times every day I would dictate my latest thoughts about what I was planning what I had succeeded in doing and what my impressions were of people who just left the office. So I tried to put down in my diary things that wouldn't come out in the public print. You know every Friday there's published every word that a president says every question that he answers every statement that he ,INTERVIEWER, In public right?,INTERVIEWEE, In public. So I try to put in my diary things that weren't going to be in that public diary. So when I got homeI never looked at it again. But when I got home I had 5000 pages of diary notes that had been typed up. I still have those one of two copies in the world one in my room at home my study and the other one at the Carter Presidential Library. So this is about 20 percent of the total words that are in my original diary.,INTERVIEWER, If you go to diary can you read it allif you go to the center?,INTERVIEWEE, After a yearI think when the paperback of this book comes out I'm going to make it available to scholars and news reporters to go to the presidential library and read the original taped original.,INTERVIEWER, I'm told that if you're a diaristthat's what they call themyou must write every day no matter how bad the day.,INTERVIEWEE, I do that.,INTERVIEWER, You did that?,INTERVIEWEE, I probably wrote more in the bad days than I did the good days because that was more memorable more emotional for me. And I wanted to get down how I felt about things and issues and people more than I did what I actuallyyou know what I actually did and activities. ,INTERVIEWER, We're going to have you read onea couple of excerpts from the book. But this is from the Inauguration Day January 20th 1977. We printed it out to make it easier. Good. "I think the inauguration speech itself perhaps one of the briefest on record for the first inauguration for president was quite compatible with my announcement speech in December of 1974 and also with my acceptance speech at the Democratic Convention. It accurately expressed some of the major themes of my administration. Even though I had been preparing to be president I was genuinely surprised when the benediction by the bishop of Minnesota referred to blessings on President Carter. Just the phrase President Carter was startling to me." Well you know I had been a peanut farmer. I hadyou know who the first presidentDemocratic president I ever met? Bill Clinton. No kidding.,INTERVIEWEE, No kidding. I had neverI was just out of the peanut fields. I met NixonPresident Nixonafter I became governor. So I was new at the presidential level. And it was kind of startling to me to be called president.,INTERVIEWER, How long does it take to get into the job?,INTERVIEWEE, Well I had to get into that first day because I had a lot to do when I came off the reviewing stand. You know immediately to make ,INTERVIEWER, I remember you walked.,INTERVIEWEE,make official things that I had decided to do. One of the things I did was among the most controversial I ever did. And that was to pardon the so-called draft dodgers who escaped into Canada. And I did that before I ever began to walk down toward the Oval Office.,INTERVIEWER, Wow. Did that come up in the campaign that issue?,INTERVIEWEE, No it never did. No.,INTERVIEWER, But you knew you were going to do it?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes I knew I was going to do it. A lot of people that were families of those men whoand a few women I thinkwho went to Canada and they werethey wanted to come back home. So I just issued a blanket pardon for them. I got some criticism obviously because a lot of folks thought the draft dodgers should be executed for treason and so forth.,INTERVIEWER, It's funnynot funny but that you would be here on the opening day of the annual UN opening that your book would be published at the same time and that Iran is always in the news. We're going to be talking to President Ahmadinejad on Wednesday. ,INTERVIEWEE, All right.,INTERVIEWER, And now we have this lady held more than a year on spying charges and Iran says they want eight arrested Iranians released. What do you make of all of this?,INTERVIEWEE, Well first of all I think we ought to keep maximum communication with leaders and their nations with whom we disagree. And I know that President Obama promised he was going to do that when he went into office. But I think that's important. And I don't knowI don't know what charges are against the eight Iranians. I understand they violated the sanction against Iran somehow or another. But I hope that the two that are still remaining over there her fiance and her friend would be released. I just got back from North Korea. You may know I went over there to get one of our young men from Boston Elijah Gomes who walked across a frozen river from China into North Korea and he was arrested. He was sentenced to eight years in prison and fined 700000 US dollars. So I just got him out. But he made a mistake and he admitted it that he shouldn't have gone into North Korea. So shethey say that they didn't know they were crossing the border.,INTERVIEWER, We have the one woman out. Would you go there to try to get the other two? If they asked you?,INTERVIEWEE, If I was asked to go I would. But you know I'm not the most popular person still in Iran soalthough as soon as the Shah fell left Iran against my wishes I immediately established diplomatic relations with the revolutionary government under the Ayatollah Khomeini. So we had full diplomatic relations and full communications. Those were my diplomats over there under the revolutionary government that were captured.,INTERVIEWER, Do we take his seriously or not?,INTERVIEWEE, I think you have to take him seriously because withinas I said within bounds he speaks for the ultimate authorities in Iran when he says something. He couldn't get too far removed from what they want him to say.,INTERVIEWER, All right. Do you think Iran today more or less a threat?,INTERVIEWEE, I think ,INTERVIEWER, Are you concerned about them?,INTERVIEWEE, I am. Yes I am. Because they feel isolated from the western world first of all. And we make constant threats that we are going to bomb them as you know if they don't comply with our wishes on the nuclear proposals. I think theymy own belief is they are planning to make a nuclear weapon a nuclear explosive. They claim they are not. So that's of great concern to me because it will disturb the status quo in the Middle East region.,INTERVIEWER, So what do we do though?,INTERVIEWEE, I would like to see us have more easy communication with them to negotiate directly with them talk to them. That's what Obama promised before he was president. So far we haven't been able to do that effectively. They haven't responded very favorably either. So I think communicate with them and stop threatening that we're going to attack them because if there are moderate I would say ultimate leaders in the religious circles of Iran who are doubtful about whether or not to have a nuclear weapon the more we threaten them and isolate them from us the more likely they are to go with a nuclear weapon.,INTERVIEWER, We have a new health care bill.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, First one ever passed in 75 years. And in your book Ted Kennedy is generally perceived as the creator of this or inspired it.,INTERVIEWEE, Of course. ,INTERVIEWER, Here in your book you say the late senator killed health care reform back in 1978. You describe him as having an irresponsible and abusive attitude essentially accusing him of blocking health care out of personal spite.,INTERVIEWEE, Well you know let me point out once more that that actually was written 31 years ago. And Kennedy ,INTERVIEWER, That was your feelings at that time.,INTERVIEWEE, He was actually running against me for president. I was holding office. He was trying to take my office away from me. And he and five other chairmen of the key committees dealing with health care all worked with me in preparing the proposal that I put forward. And so the other five leaders stayed with me. But at the last minute Ted Kennedy withdrew his support for what he had helped to draft and killed it in effect because he was a powerful and influential senator at f that time. And he washe had two motivations I'm guessing now. He didn't want to give me a great success since he hoped to knock me off as president. And secondly I think he saw that if he could kill my bill then maybe later on when he became president which he hoped to do in 1981 then he could put his own bill forward as a much more complete bill.,INTERVIEWER, Actually that was written as you said 31 years ago. But his former chief of staff Larry Horowitz called the criticism that you did in the book "sad classless clearly embittered." You could have chosen to leave that out.,INTERVIEWEE, Well you know I didn't leave out anything that I thought was pertinent even though it was very frank and although I had great admiration for Senator Kennedy as one of the most wonderful and successful senators we ever had. And I would say that after I left office he and I became adequately reconciled. He worked very closely with my wife Rose on health legislation and that sort of thing. So we were basically friends after I left office.,INTERVIEWER, So it's just an honest that's what it was?,INTERVIEWEE, That's what happened. It's all in the record. I actually quote the laws that I put forward that would have given catastrophic coverage to everybody in America would add 16 million people that would have complete health insurance. And in four years it would have given comprehensive health coverage to every person in America. And it was killed.,INTERVIEWER, We're back with President Jimmy Carter. "The White House Diary" just published. This is it's opening day in a sense. All right Obama signed the health care bill six months ago. What did you think of it? And why are youare you surprised that more Americans oppose it than favor it?,INTERVIEWEE, Well I was delighted when it passed. I thought it could possibly have been much more aggressive with a single payer simple system. That's what I personally preferred. But he did the best he could under extremely difficult circumstances with no Republicans helping him. And I think the negative aspect to it is because of the total distortion of the news that Fox broadcasting has perpetrated on the American people when they hammer away day after day after day that his health program will kill old people and things of that kind. A lot of gullible folks in the United States actually believe what Fox puts forward as facts when most of it is just complete distortions. And they've also attempted to twist around what his religious faith is and whether or not he's an American and so forth. So I think that's a new version of cable news that was not there thank goodness when I was there. But I would attribute most of the negative attitude not to the facts but to the distorted facts that comes out of the Fox.,INTERVIEWER, What do make of all this? Tea Party Fox the Glenn Becks of the world? What do you make of this phenomenon in a sense.,INTERVIEWEE, Well I'm very disturbed about it. I can't really criticize the Tea Party people because I came into the White House pretty much on the same basis that they have become popular. That is dissatisfaction with the way things are going in Washington and disillusionment and disencouragement about the government. But that's what happened before I ran for president. Had it not been for that feeling in the country I would not have been elected. For instance we were just out of the embarrassment of Watergate and the defeat in Vietnam and the fact that a lot of people lied about what was going on in Vietnam the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. and both of the Kennedy brothers and the revelation by Frank Church Committee that the United States government and the CIA and some presidents had actually perpetrated murder in other countries. All of that had brought about a feeling among the people that something was wrong in our government. And I think that's what's being utilized by the Tea Party people to arouse animosity.,INTERVIEWER, Are you saying all's fair?,INTERVIEWEE, Well it is fair. My guess is that the Tea Party will be very influential in the upcoming election in the midterm election this coming November. My guess is that they'll soon be absorbed ineach other will absorb the Republican party and the Tea Party movement. So a couple of years from now maybe in 2012 when the presidential election comes on I think the Tea Party will be not a unique startling newcomer on the political scene but all hat stuff.,INTERVIEWER, Bill Clinton said the Tea Party supporters have good impulses calls the movement a general revolt against bigness.,INTERVIEWEE, I think it is a general result against something that many of them don't like yes.,INTERVIEWER, How much of it do you think is racist? We have a black president.,INTERVIEWEE, I don't think the Tea Party people are racist except maybe a tiny portion of them. But there has been a deliberate effortagain referring to Fox Broadcastingto inject the race issue into it. They have actually called Obama a racist on television. And when they say like some of the leaders of the Republican party have said that he's epitomizing the tribal influence of his father from Kenya you know that obviously has political connotations. So I thinkI mean racist connotations. So I think some of it is racist. But I don't blame the Tea Party movement for ,INTERVIEWER, What do you make of Gingrich's recent suggestion?,INTERVIEWEE, I was talking about Gingrich.,INTERVIEWER, Kenyan but also anti-colonial.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes I was talking about Gingrich. I think that Gingrich five years ago would be embarrassed at what Newt Gingrich is saying today and doing today.,INTERVIEWER, Why isn't it embarrassing today?,INTERVIEWEE, I think he has ambitions to be a presidential candidate. And he thinks that to go hard right and to appeal to the extreme even Tea Party movement members may be beneficial to him politically.,INTERVIEWER, All right. What is your read on Obama?,INTERVIEWEE, I think he's a good solid intelligent man who is suffering from perhaps the worst Washington environment of any president in history and I would even include Abraham Lincoln as we led up to the war between the states. No other president has faced such a polarized Congress where he can hardly get one or two votes you know out of hundreds who are Republicans in the House and the Senate. So he has had to overcome that. And I think he's had remarkable success in light of that handicap.,INTERVIEWER, Back with former President Jimmy Carter. The occasionthis is book number what?,INTERVIEWEE, Twenty six.,INTERVIEWER, His 26th book "White House Diary." an extraordinary account of his years in the presidency in which he kept a daily diary by dictating every day sometimes three four times a day. All right you write extensively of course about the Mideast. I remember great interviews we did about ,INTERVIEWEE, I remember.,INTERVIEWER,the summit at Camp David and everything. But most particularly about Camp David and your efforts then. You got a peace treaty that still exists.,INTERVIEWEE, That's right. Not a word has been violated in 32 years.,INTERVIEWER, Amazing. The only one ever I think between them. What are your expectations of this next go around?,INTERVIEWEE, I think if anybody can be successful Hillary Clinton is the right one to be the chief negotiator. She's competent. She knows her background. She's I think very forceful. And she is determined to prevail. And if she can get any sort of glimmer of accommodation by both sides at the same time I think she'll be successful. But I wouldn't bet on it because I know that s intransigence is involved there.,INTERVIEWER, How frustrating is it to be a deal maker there?,INTERVIEWEE, Well it's very frustrating. As I wrote in my diary every day I meanI had probably 50 entrieswhat Israel has wanted is to keep the West Bank. And that's the main thing they haven't yielded on in 30 years. They gave up the Sinai. They didn't want the Gaza Strip ever. But they've always wanted to keep the West Bank. So they've got now control over probably more than 50 percent of the West Bank including all of the Jordan River Valley and multiple settlements as you know between Jerusalem and the Jordan River. So I think that's basically the cause of the problem. And if they would ,INTERVIEWER, Israel's the cause by keeping it?,INTERVIEWEE, Well there's faults on both sides but that's the thing that has not changed. Of course the Palestinian issue has changed a lot. They have had three elections. The Carter Center and I have been there for every election. But obviously the unwillingness of the Palestinians to make concessions and to agree to accept Israel's existence and right to live in peace is a major factor as well. And the violence on both sides has been a major factor. But the unchanging issue is Israel's desire to keep the West Bank.,INTERVIEWER, But when Prime Minister Netanyahu was here a little while ago he said he was open to anything. Just let's sit and talk.,INTERVIEWEE, I pray that that's the case.,INTERVIEWER, You don't believe it?,INTERVIEWEE, I don't know. We'll have to see. I don't know. But I think Hillary will give them every chance to make the right concessions to move forward.,INTERVIEWER, You're impressed with her?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes I am. I met with her the other day when I came back from North Korea with messages from them leading toward de- nuclearization of the peninsula and peace. I enjoyed meeting with her. She was very open minded. She was very inquisitive. She was knowledgeable. I know that she is a competent person who would do the best she can. And I think that she sees that this is her chance to do something that others haven't been able to do.,INTERVIEWER, What about those on the far left the extremists on both sides who hinder this process?,INTERVIEWEE, That's ,INTERVIEWER, Bombers you know the suicides.,INTERVIEWEE, I know. That's a case on both sides as you say. And I would say that Menachim Begin when he left Camp David had made a much more courageous decision than either Sadat made or I. And that was a major step forward. And of course it led to a complete treaty of peace between Israel and the other Arab countries that challenger them or threaten them you know militarily with whom they had been at war four times in the 25 years before I became president. But Israel didn't carry out the commitments that they made to me and President Sadat about no more settlements and having the West Bank be turned over to the Palestinians. But I have always admired Begin because of that.,INTERVIEWER, Do you think you get a bad wrap over the Israeli/Palestinian issue from the Israeli side?,INTERVIEWEE, Well I lost a major portion of the Israeli political support in 1980 not all of it. I mean but compared to what I had done in 1976 and what other Democratic presidents have done. And a lot of them felt that I took an even-handed stance between Israel and the Palestinians and even-handed is not acceptable to many people. And also I have had severe criticisms from Netanyahu and a few others because I gave away the Sinai Desert from Israel back to Egypt. So that's comprehensible. I am not complaining about it because I can see how people who are completely committed to Israel want to have Israel prevail on every issue.,INTERVIEWER, We're back with former President Jimmy Carter. The book is "White House Diary." The Obamas wept to church yesterday. Some said only becausehe's not basically a church goer. He was back in Chicago but sincebecause he's being tagged as non-Christian. What do you make of that?,INTERVIEWEE, Well I'm glad he went to church. And I don't think it was just that. I think he is a deeply religious person. He's obviously a Christian. And many presidents have not been to church. Reagan didn't go to church while he was president or before or after as a regular thing although I don't doubt his Christianity. But different people have different approaches. I went to the First Baptist Church every Sunday. If I was at Camp David we had church at Camp David.,INTERVIEWER, Are you still a lay preacher?,INTERVIEWEE, I teach the Bible every Sunday at home.,INTERVIEWER, You've always gone?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes I have.,INTERVIEWER, What do you make of Obama going at this particular time?,INTERVIEWEE, I'm glad he went. I think maybeI don't know his motivation. Maybe he just wanted to worship. Or maybe he wanted to let people be reminded accurately that he is a devout Christian. It's the certain prerogative of any human being including presidents.,INTERVIEWER, What keeps your faith with all you see around you?,INTERVIEWEE, It's ait's a basic precise of my moral and practical life. I've been a Christian all my life since I was three years old and was going to church. My father was a Sunday schoolteacher like I am now. And it's been a great solace to me in times of trial and disappointment or sorrow or failure or disillusionment. I prayed more whenthe last year I was in office than I ever have before or since while the hostages were being held. My prayer was never that I would prevail or win or anything but that every hostage would come home safe and free. And my prayers were answered as you know. And so I've been basically at ease with my faith. And I enjoy each Sunday that I'm home about 35 times a year teaching the Bible. I teach half the time in Hebrew text Old Testament and half the time in the New Testament.,INTERVIEWER, What do you make of the Islamic center controversy here just a couple mimes from where we are?,INTERVIEWEE, They ought to build it. They have a perfect right to build it. This is a part of our nation's premise freedom of religion. And not only freedom of religion but equality among the religions as far as the preference of worshippers is concerned. I think it's gotten a little bit false to say well they have a constitutional right to do it but they can't do it; we're not going to let them do it. I think they ought to go ahead and build it.,INTERVIEWER, You understand the unrest though?,INTERVIEWEE, I do. Well let themlet there be some unrest. It's two complete blocks away from so-called holy ground of the disaster in 9/11. And it's not an intrusion on any other beliefs. And also it's surrounded by I understand strip joints and commercial establishments and so forth. It's just a contrivance in my opinion by people who want to arouse anti-Islamic feelings.,INTERVIEWER, What do you make of the president's handling so far of Afghanistan?,INTERVIEWEE, Well he inherited the Afghanistan problem. I was involved in the Afghan problem from the beginning. On Christmas day of 1979 the Soviets began to haul in about 12000 troops and they invaded Afghanistan. That was the beginning of the problem. They stayed there about eight years until Gorbachev finally decided to bring them out. And in that time I gave the Afghan freedom fighterswe called themevery possible support I could in a clandestine or secret way. In fact all the weapons that I gave them were soviet weapons that we got from Egypt and from Saudi Arabia and from Pakistan. We didn't use American weapons. And eventually the freedom fighters prevailed. When the Soviets did withdraw Gorbachev did it. I think if we had just gone in then and spent a tenth as much as we're spending now on weapons and fighting and rebuilt Afghanistan there would never have been an opening for al Qaeda to go in. So I hope we'll get out of Afghanistan as soon as possible and maybe work with moderate members of the Talibanand there are many of themand try to have some accommodations with them.,INTERVIEWER, We're back with President Carter. The book "White House Diary." Colin Powell says that Obama has lost some of his ability to connect with the public that he needs to be like a razor blade and go after the employment issue. Be more forceful.,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah. Well I don't think there's any doubt that he sapped away a lot of his political popularity concentrating so heavily on getting the health bill passed. And I think a lot of people feel maybe legitimately that if he had concentrated more on jobs jobs jobs instead of anything else he would be more politically popular now. But that was a great achievement for health care. And I think in the long run it is going to be very good for our country. But I believe that what Colin said is accurate. But I don't blame President Obama for having made that choice.,INTERVIEWER, It is still a ways away but is he in political trouble in 2012?,INTERVIEWEE, I think the situation politically is going to be quite different in 2012 from what it is this time. I think in 2010 the midterm elections the Democrats are going to be faced with some pretty heavy defeats. I think that he's got plenty of time to repair any political damage. My hope is that we'll see some improvement made in employment and in the economy. And so I believe that he's got a good chance not only to be the nominee which I had to fight for which I don't think he'll have to fight for but to be re-elected.,INTERVIEWER, You don't think any Democrat would challenge him?,INTERVIEWEE, I can't imagine that again.,INTERVIEWER, Is there any Republican on the horizon you as a Democrat worry about?,INTERVIEWEE, Well I worry about whichever one they might choose because it's obviously going to be a tough campaign. And I would hate to see the Republicans take over the White House and the House and maybe even the Senate. I think our country would be put back there if that should happen economically and in every other way. So I can't pick out one Republican that would concern me more than others.,INTERVIEWER, What do you make of former Governor Palin?,INTERVIEWEE, I think she's a vivid political person that has made a major impact on the consciousness of the America both whether you like her or don't like her. I think she's extremely eloquent. She knows how to appeal to whatever audience is in front of her. And she has tremendous influence as she demonstrated for instance just recently in Delaware where she went in and endorsed an unknown woman who then prevailed in the Republican primary. I think that even the Republicans from what polls I have seen don't see her as a potential president. But they look on her with admiration.,INTERVIEWER, Do you see her as a potential president?,INTERVIEWEE, I hope not no. I don't see her as a potential president.,INTERVIEWER, Do you see her as a candidate? ,INTERVIEWEE, I think she'll be very shrewd in making a decision to run for president depending on what the public opinion polls show about her being acceptable among Republicans. I think if she sees she can get the Republican nomination she'll go for it. But so far according to the polls I've seen I'm completely outside of it.,INTERVIEWER, Have you ever seen this country as divided as it is?,INTERVIEWEE, It never has been this divided. I don't think it was this divided as I said even during the time of Abraham Lincoln. Obviously during the war the Civil War the war between the states it was divided severely. But no it's not been this divided. You know I had superb bipartisan support when I was president. As the years went by of my own presidency and ClintonI mean excuse me Senator Kennedy made more and more strong challenge to me he sapped away the liberal members of the Democratic party. And I turned more and more toward the moderate to conservative Democrats. Also to the Republicans. But I had Congressman Michael in the House and Baker in the Senate Howard Baker who really helped me inon key votes. So I got superb support from Republicans and Democrats.,INTERVIEWER, There is no one like that around.,INTERVIEWEE, No. There's no one like that around. And now they have kind of a solemn oath they take. If you're a Republican don't vote for Obama no matter what he proposes even if it's good stuff.,INTERVIEWER, We're going to have the president read another excerpt from "White House Diary." This is the day he leaves office the inauguration of President Reagan.,INTERVIEWEE, This is exactly four years after the first one. "On the inaugural platform my feelings were of regret that I had lost the election but a sense of relief to be free of the responsibilities for a while. Persistent though was my concern that at the last minute the hostages might not be released. I watched the ceremonies as a somewhat detached spectator without any emotional feelings. I thought that the speech was remarkable hackneyed nothing new just a collection of campaign material. I was glancing back at the Secret Service agent with the MC said would the president and First Lady please come forward. I had an involuntary inclination to stand up with Rosalyn but I realized he was talking about the Reagans." And then two minutes later I was informed that the hostage plane had taken off. They had been sitting in the plane since 10:00 that morning free and ready to be released.,INTERVIEWER, You're very critical of this book of the Washington press corp. Does that still stand?,INTERVIEWEE, I think they're much better now than they were when I was president. I was critical of them because I thought there was a great distortion of what I was trying to do and doing. And ,INTERVIEWER, Couldn't George Bush say the same thing?,INTERVIEWEE, I think any president might want to say the same thing except maybe a few. I think President Reagan was kind of a darling of the press a lot of his term. And I think probably John Kennedy was another one who enjoyed favorable reaction from ,INTERVIEWER, Personality counts?,INTERVIEWEE, It does count a lot. And the ability to be part of their environment. You're part of their environment too. I think Lyndon Johnson had a really hard time with the White House press corp.,INTERVIEWER, What do you make of the Jon Stewart and StephenI know you're a Jon Stewart fan.,INTERVIEWEE, I am.,INTERVIEWER, You'll be on his show later tonight?,INTERVIEWEE, That's true.,INTERVIEWER, What do you make of his rally? Rally to Restore Sanity?,INTERVIEWEE, And to preserve fear I think is what Colbert says. I think it will be an interesting event. I believe it will be a pretty large turnout. I think there will be a lot of humor in it. And it is going to be interesting to watch how they avoid any alignment towards a liberal or a conservative philosophy and make sure they stay kind of out of politics and still retain their role as humorous.,INTERVIEWER, It s obviously in retaliation to the Tea Party and the Glenn Beck rally.,INTERVIEWEE, That's what I surmise. Of course Jon Stewart hadn't told me that I don't think he's told his viewers yet exactly what his motivations are except as you say just to bring rationality back to the political debate and discussion.,INTERVIEWER, We're back with President Carter. The book "White House Diary." What's next? Can you go solve a war somewhere solve peace go to an election? You're not going to stop.,INTERVIEWEE, No. I just got back from North Korea and China. And we stay in touch with about 70 countries around the world which is the work of the Carter Center. So I'll continue to do that kind of work. Most of our effort at the Carter Center is in diseases curing and preventing and eradicating terrible diseases that still afflict the poorest and most helpless and needy people on earth. So I'll stay involved in the Carter Center as long as I'm physically and mentally able. I'm still a professor at Emory University. This is my 29th year as a professor. And I'll still write a book every now and then.,INTERVIEWER, I know that. Many people you write about Hamilton Jordan Jody Powell Ted Kennedy Ronald Reagan Jerry Ford Anwar Sadat Yitzhak Rabin Scoop Jackson Robert Byrd they're all gone. Does that give you pause?,INTERVIEWEE, Menachim Begin. It does.,INTERVIEWER, Do you think about mortality?,INTERVIEWEE, The book is dedicated to Hamilton Jordan and to Jody Powell who were just about like my own sons and who helped me become and be president and governor. So it was with a great deal of emotion that I dedicated this book to them. But yes times change and people go on. And I think one thing I would like to remind the readers of this book although there's some very controversial and sometimes critical comments in there about me and them is that the book was written 30 years ago. And times have changed. And I changed my opinion about a lot of people but ,INTERVIEWER, So read it with that?,INTERVIEWEE, It's an absolutely frank honest undisturbed unmodifiedI didn't change a single sentence meaning in the book about what it means to be president and to point out 30 or 40 things in the book really that I had to address that were very serious to me that Obama is having to address today.,INTERVIEWER, Frank Sinatra told me the sad thing about aging is your friends are gone.,INTERVIEWEE, That's exactly right.,INTERVIEWER, Same with you?,INTERVIEWEE, It's sad of course. And every year it seems like more and more of them pass away. Some of those much earlier than they should have like Jody and Hamilton who were a generation behind me.,INTERVIEWER, And your brother?,INTERVIEWEE, And my brother Billy who was 13 years younger than I was. So we have to be prepared for that.,INTERVIEWER, How's your health?,INTERVIEWEE, My health is good thank goodness.,INTERVIEWER, You're an amazing guy.,INTERVIEWEE, Thank you Larry for letting me come.,INTERVIEWER, And you're a regular viewer which we count on.,INTERVIEWEE, I certainly am and have been for a long time.,INTERVIEWER, So what else can she do? And how is she going to do it? Oprah for the hour next on Larry King Live. When we asked her to do this about six months ago she readily said yes. I can't thank you enough.,INTERVIEWEE, No I'm happy to be here. I can't believe its 50 years for you.,INTERVIEWER, Fifty years.,INTERVIEWEE, What does it feel like?,INTERVIEWER, Fifty years.,INTERVIEWEE, Fifty years?,INTERVIEWER, I remember it like it was yesterday.,INTERVIEWEE, Do you really?,INTERVIEWER, Yeah I can remember my first day on air. Do you want to do 50?,INTERVIEWEE, You know what? I don't think I'll be doing 50. And it's so interesting because I remember when Donahue was on. And Donahue did 25 and everyone said Donahue's 25. You thinkand I said never I will do 25. It looks like God willing I will make 25 yeah.,INTERVIEWER, I first met Oprah going on her show in Baltimore.,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah. In 19seventy-something.,INTERVIEWER, '78 or '79.,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah. That's right.,INTERVIEWER, And you brought my daughter on as a surprise guest.,INTERVIEWEE, How old is she now? How old is she?,INTERVIEWER, Thirty-nine.,INTERVIEWEE, Ayeeee. Ayeee. Oh my God.,INTERVIEWER, Do you feel your importance? Do you sense it?,INTERVIEWEE, No. If you're saying that I'm important I understand that I have ...,INTERVIEWER, Clout.,INTERVIEWEE, I understand that I have a wonderful platform that we've built over the years and I remember when you were doing your column forDo you remember this?,INTERVIEWER, "USA Today.",INTERVIEWEE, "USA Today." And you had written a column and you said I would like to know who her publicist is. Do you remember that?,INTERVIEWER, Yes.,INTERVIEWEE, Years ago. And at the time my publicist was an intern girl who had started the very first day I did who had not a clue aboutAlice McGee (ph) who later became a producer and later helped develop our book club idea. But when you wrote that article I said if he only knew that my publicist was a young girl who started the same day I did. Her first day out of college and I said to her when I started getting lots of mail I said Alice would you help me with the mail? I'll pay you a dollar a letter. And then I started getting so much mail I said I can't afford a dollar a letter anymore. So yeah it's been a great ride for me. It's been really ...,INTERVIEWER, During an interview you did with us in September you said I don't feel like I have used my life to the highest good.,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah.,INTERVIEWER, Has that changed since opening the schools?,INTERVIEWEE, Well the opening of the school was one of the greatest days I've ever experienced. Ever. I felt like I had 20 weddings all in one. It felt like everything I'd heard people say weddings were. Like it's like out of body you don't remember what happened you're sort of floating through it. So the opening of my leadership academy felt like that but it also felt like for me the process of getting to something is as good as actually arriving there. So the process of building the school and working for years to make it happen that was really wonderful. And then to sort of be there and actually see that these girls' lives were going to change it was really wonderful.,INTERVIEWER, So do you sometimes feel what's left to do?,INTERVIEWEE, No I don't feel that at all.,INTERVIEWER, You don't at all.,INTERVIEWEE, No. Do you?,INTERVIEWER, No. I don't.,INTERVIEWEE, No. OK. I know Katie is interviewing you tomorrow night but I thought I might give myself a little shot here.,INTERVIEWER, What do you want to do ...,INTERVIEWEE, Well.,INTERVIEWER, ... that you haven't done?,INTERVIEWEE, There's several things that I really want to do. I am on the airI am going to beI have like four five years left on my show and when I'm done with that contract I'm going to be done. I'm ...,INTERVIEWER, That's a done deal.,INTERVIEWEE, I'm going to be done. When I'm done I'm done.,INTERVIEWER, You have an announcement to make.,INTERVIEWEE, No. It's not an announcement. I'm just saying when I'm done I'm done.,INTERVIEWER, OK.,INTERVIEWEE, OK. But before I'm done I really doI feel strongly that I want that-my so-called legacy everybody uses the word "legacy." I want the work the body of work for that show to have been not just for myself but for all the people who watch me and have grown up with me. No I'm sure you get it too people say I've been watching you since I was four. ,INTERVIEWER, It's scary.,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah it is. It's scary when somebody says that. But I want to have changed the laws the laws state by state for child predators in this country. That's what I want to have done. And I won't be satisfied until that is done.,INTERVIEWER, You want to be then a political activist?,INTERVIEWEE, Is that what that's called?,INTERVIEWER, You're going to have to appear before state legislatures.You're going to have to change laws.,INTERVIEWEE, Is that what that's called then?,INTERVIEWER, Yeah. An activist.,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah. OK. That's what I'll be then. I didn't know it had a name. Because what I was going to do I was going to use the public to help me because I'm not going to do it by myself.,INTERVIEWER, You've got a platform.,INTERVIEWEE, I've got a great platform. And you were asking me the question about clout. What's the point of clout if you can't do something with it? So I thought I would use the clout to garner support from everybody else who is as outraged as me as I am.,INTERVIEWER, We've got to cover a lot of topics tonight.,INTERVIEWEE, OK.,INTERVIEWER, And it's an honor to have you.,INTERVIEWEE, I was going to bring youwhat do you give you? I was on my way here and I was I should be taking something like a ...,INTERVIEWER, For you it would be a Mercedes Benz ...,INTERVIEWEE, I don't know. What do you need though?,INTERVIEWER, I don't know. I need your just being here.,INTERVIEWEE, OK.,INTERVIEWER, It's pleasure enough.,INTERVIEWEE, I did two shows and I came and I wanted to say happy anniversary.,INTERVIEWER, You did a show last Thursday with the Rutgers basketball team.,INTERVIEWEE, Right. Right.,INTERVIEWER, What is your read on the Imus story?,INTERVIEWEE, Ooh. I knew that. My read on the Imus story is that first of all I felt as theas Vivian Stringer the coach felt. I didn't have any great ideas about whether he should or shouldn't be fired. I felt that that would be left up to his bosses who have obviously decided that was what should happen. I know that I have my own radio channel and if somebody on my radio channel had made such degrading remarks I would have fired them. But I wasn'tI didn't want to get into it whether he should or should not because I think that should be left up to his bosses but the thing that really really saddened me is that we have reached a point in our society where someone could feel comfortable making such degrading remarks about women and not just women but racial remarks against women. So it was both racial and anti-feminist I thought.,INTERVIEWER, So when you hear something like I-man said do you cringe do you get angry what is your reaction?,INTERVIEWEE, No because he wasn't talkingI cringe not because I feel this because Imus has no power in my life. And I would want those women to also know that when they were on my show and they were saying that he spoiled their moment and that it ruined it for them what I wanted to say but I had seven minutes is that he can't do that. He doesn't have the power to do that. Nobody has the power to do that to you. So I cringed because the very notion that we live in a society where anyone can call women "hos" makes me cringe.,INTERVIEWER, We're back with Oprah kicking off our 50th anniversary week.,INTERVIEWEE, Katie Couric is here tomorrow. Katie is interviewing you. ,INTERVIEWER, She is going to interview me. And then Wednesday night two hour special ...,INTERVIEWEE, Is she going to interview you like this or is she going to interview you by satellite?,INTERVIEWER, No no. Like this.,INTERVIEWEE, Like this. OK.,INTERVIEWER, We'll be in New York.,INTERVIEWEE, OK. And then Friday night is everybody.,INTERVIEWER, Bill Maher hosting a show with a lot of surprise guests. On this program ...,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah.,INTERVIEWER, ... you endorsed Barack Obama.,INTERVIEWEE, Mm-hmm.,INTERVIEWER, For the president. That still sticks right?,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah. Of course. ,INTERVIEWER, Can a black man be elected president of the United States?,INTERVIEWEE, I believe he can. I believe a black man can and I believe he can.,INTERVIEWER, You think he is going to win the nomination?,INTERVIEWEE, I'm not here to say whether he will win or not but you asked me do I believe that he can? I believe that he can. Is it possible? Yes. I do believe that it's possible.,INTERVIEWER, Have you endorsed a candidate before?,INTERVIEWEE, Never.,INTERVIEWER, What made you do so now?,INTERVIEWEE, Because I know him personally. I think that what he stands for what he has proven that he can stand for what he has shown was worth me going out on a limb for and I haven't done it in the past because I haven't felt that anybodyI didn't know anybody well enough to be able to say I believe in this person.,INTERVIEWER, Is there a side of you the woman side that would lead toward a Hillary?,INTERVIEWEE, Well I have great respect for Hillary Clinton. II think I've said this before and it's true. Because I am for Barack does not mean I am against Hillary or anybody else. So the fact that I would endorse Barack Obama and the fact that I would support Barack Obama I have not one negative thing to say about Hillary Clinton.,INTERVIEWER, Just you like Barack Obama?,INTERVIEWEE, I like Barack Obama.,INTERVIEWER, Have you contributed to him?,INTERVIEWEE, I haven't contributed.,INTERVIEWER, Would you?,INTERVIEWEE, Well the truth of the matter is whether I contribute or not contribute you are limited to how much you contribute so my money isn't going to make any difference to him. I think that my value to him my support of him is probably worth more than any check ...,INTERVIEWER, Dollars.,INTERVIEWEE, ... that I could write. Yeah.,INTERVIEWER, Run for office yourself?,INTERVIEWEE, You know that is not going to ever happen.,INTERVIEWER, Because? Why?,INTERVIEWEE, Because we just said I'm going to become a political activist and I feel that ...,INTERVIEWER, The next step could be ...,INTERVIEWEE, But no. I feel that the platform that I hold the chair in which I get to sit in every day and speak to the world is of far more value to me than any political office could be. Value in that I get to speak to people's hearts and get to connect with people all over the world. Like right now. This is so amazing. Usually I'm in a gym in South Africa in the middle of the morning because I can't sleep watching you and so are other people in the gym. Soplaces all over the world 200 countries. No matter what is going on around what country you are in you are there.,INTERVIEWER, It's weird.,INTERVIEWEE, It's really weird. And then it's interesting. It's the one comforting thing when you're in a foreign country. There's Larry. Hi Larry. No matter what there's Larry.,INTERVIEWER, Satellites are amazing.,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah.,INTERVIEWER, Speaking of countries and South Africa one of my favorite places by the way.,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah.,INTERVIEWER, When I visited there and went to Mandela's house ...,INTERVIEWEE, Uh-huh.,INTERVIEWER, How did you get the idea to open that academy?,INTERVIEWEE, Because I was sitting with Nelson Mandela one of my personal heroes. And I don't know if I told you this story before but when I was doing Christmas kindness in South Africa I was invited to stay at Nelson Mandela's house and I was reallyI don't get nervous about meeting people but I was a little nervous about being in Nelson Mandela's house for 10 days straight. So I had 29 meals with him. Breakfast lunch and dinner. Twenty nine meals. And in the beginning I was really worried about what are we going to talk about? What am I going to say? And Steadman said relax he's Nelson Mandela. He'll no what to say you'll just listen. And that's what happened. It was like one of the most amazing experiences of my life. So I love South Africa.,INTERVIEWER, But that led to opening a school?,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah. I was sitting in his living room one day and we were talking about what was needed and what I could do and I said what I wanted to do is build a school because I believe that education can save the world. And that would be the mark that I get to leave on the world is that I throughout developing countries when you say is there anything left to do there are 100 million girls in the world right now who will never have the opportunity to go to elementary school. Before I die I want that to change.,INTERVIEWER, You're going to build more schools?,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah. I'm going to build more schools. I just spoke with a school outside of Durban about three hours outside of Durban actually I didn't built it I organized the process of building it but took the money from the people who gave it to me for my Angel Network and we built a model school. I mean train the women how to make the bricks in the village went out into the communities and met with people for a year and said to people tell us what you need for a school. And these are poor villagers no running water no electricity. We built a channel underneath the school and built a windmill so that the children play on it and pump the war. So wewhen it rains we save the water and pump the water so now they have toilets.,INTERVIEWER, How do you react to the critics who say why not build it in Montgomery Alabama?,INTERVIEWEE, Because we have a government that builds schools. I don't have to do that. I live in the best country in the world. I live in the country where had I not had the opportunities that I've had thank God almighty born in 1954 I wouldn't be able to sit here with you or to stand where I stand every day. So we live in a country where education is free. That's what people miss. That education is free in this country. So I want to make that possible for children in the world who don't have that opportunity.,INTERVIEWER, By the way in honor of Oprah ...,INTERVIEWEE, You wear the color purple.,INTERVIEWER, Which is still on Broadway right?,INTERVIEWEE, It's still on Broadway and opening in Chicago on May 1st and moving out throughout the country.,INTERVIEWER, You said in an interview last year that you failed in an effort to mentor a group of girls from your adopted hometown of Chicago.,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah.,INTERVIEWER, How?,INTERVIEWEE, I failed because I think it's really nice to do nice things for people but I reached a point in my life where I don't just want to do nice things or do good things I really want to be able to change people's lives forever and I strongly believe that the way to do that is changing the way people think about their lives and that education - you can't change a kid unless you educate a kid you really can't. You can give them shoes you can give them a place to stay you can give them food for a day but I am in the business I think now of being able to teach people how to fish. You know that whole fish for a day or teach people how to fish. And so years ago when I first moved to Chicago because I was a poor kid and always knew that I'd have to find a way to give back and I started a mentoring program just for women in my office and going into the projects sort of adopting these girls out of the projects and trying to take them places on the weekend. The first thing I did was to take them all to get library cards. I wasn't successful because I didn't have the time or the attention to give to them that would be able to break the cycle of poverty for them.,INTERVIEWER, You learned from that.,INTERVIEWEE, SoI learned from that. You've got to be able toso that's why I decided I want to build a school that I can have the girls full time and change the way they think change what they think is possible for themselves.,INTERVIEWER, What is it like to be very poor ...,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah.,INTERVIEWER, ... and then very rich? I mean ...,INTERVIEWEE, It's the best. It's the best. It's the best. Every day I ...,INTERVIEWER, Well put.,INTERVIEWEE, It's the best because every day I think I have it so much better than people who are born rich.,INTERVIEWER, Oh yeah. So much.,INTERVIEWEE, Don't you think the fact ...,INTERVIEWER, To make it ...,INTERVIEWEE, Don't you think the fact that you had to struggle ...,INTERVIEWER, Sure.,INTERVIEWEE, The fact that you never had everything.,INTERVIEWER, But what's it like to have an absurd amount of money? By absurd amount of money in that you can ...,INTERVIEWEE, I don't call it absurd Larry.,INTERVIEWER, What do you call it?,INTERVIEWEE, I call itI don't know what I call it. I don't have a name for it but I don't think it is absurd. But I do think this is the weird thing. That even now I will be in a store and I will be looking at something and I will think should I get this one should I get the green one or the yellow one and it will dawn on me I can get both. I can get both. I can get the whole rack.,INTERVIEWER, You can get the store.,INTERVIEWEE, I can getyeah so thatsome things I have some still old habits like someone said that we were in a hotel not too long ago and it was like we're not sending out for the laundry because you know they charge you five dollars for a pair of panties. So some thingsI still can't get over some things.,INTERVIEWER, You still ...,INTERVIEWEE, Oh no.,INTERVIEWER, Four dollar handkerchiefs no.,INTERVIEWEE, Gayle will tell you this. Recently I was in a hotel and I called her and said "Call me right back." Because you know when you dial from a hotel phone if you don't use like a calling card or something it's like I don't know ...,INTERVIEWER, Eight dollars.,INTERVIEWEE, A minute. So I'll call and say will you call me back because it's too expensive. And she says who is this? Yeah. So some things like that I still hold on to.,INTERVIEWER, Are you an easy touch with old friends?,INTERVIEWEE, What does that mean?,INTERVIEWER, A guya woman calls you up who knew you when you were in high school. No. A girl who worked with you in Baltimore.,INTERVIEWEE, Uh-huh.,INTERVIEWER, Is on the skids.,INTERVIEWEE, Uh-huh.,INTERVIEWER, Easy touch?,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah.,INTERVIEWER, Are you?,INTERVIEWEE, You mean would I help you out?,INTERVIEWER, Yeah.,INTERVIEWEE, I've done that for a few people. I've done that for a few people.,INTERVIEWER, Must have a lot of people. I knew you when Oprah...,INTERVIEWEE, But this isno but this is what you have to do. This is what I've learned. You cannot. I never loan money. You only loan money Larry. You know this. You only loan money if you never want to see the person again. So that's what I call sometimes an exit fee for some people. You loan the money and you'll never have to worry about them calling you again because they won't pay you back.,INTERVIEWER, Yeah.,INTERVIEWEE, And you know they're not going to pay you back. But for the most part if somebodythat actually happened to me not too long ago. Somebody I had known in Nashville actually that helped me get into radio called and said literally helped me get into radio because I started just like you started and I said I'm going to give you this money I'm going to give you exactly this and you never have to pay me back.,INTERVIEWER, Smart thing to do.,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah. Because that way you don't have to worry about it. You know?,INTERVIEWER, We're back with Oprah and she just said ...,INTERVIEWEE, Isn't it weird we getyou get paid for talking ...,INTERVIEWER, We get paid.,INTERVIEWEE, You've been paid for 50 years for talking.,INTERVIEWER, Isn't that dumb.,INTERVIEWEE, No I ...,INTERVIEWER, It's not dumb. Because you're good at it you get paid for talking. I get paid for talking.,INTERVIEWEE, But I still am amazed at it.,INTERVIEWER, But it ain't work.,INTERVIEWEE, It's not.,INTERVIEWER, We don't go to work.,INTERVIEWEE, No. No.,INTERVIEWER, You go to your show.,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah.,INTERVIEWER, But you don't go to work.,INTERVIEWEE, No. I feel likeyou know we say this all the time on my show that you can find something you love. And I always as a kid I loved talking. I was always talking in school. I was the first woman in myand I can't believe that I get paid and paid a lot of money for talking.,INTERVIEWER, How about the down side of the business?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, How do you react to tabloids having a field day with you? You and Steadman and ...,INTERVIEWEE, I've actually grown up with it. You know we've been together now over 20 years and I've been you know this sort of known person for about the same amount of time and I have actually matured with it. It used to just make me so upset and so mad all the time. I was just talking to my friend Quincy Jones the other day. I remember years ago I was on the cover of "TV Guide" or something. They put my head on Ann Margaret's body. And I'm like crying because of crazy stuff you know like I can't believe they're saying. And I was sitting on a pile of money. They're acting like I justand so Bill Cosby had said to me one time "Put your head in a paper bag breathe deeply three times and move on." So I really have gotten to the point wherethat's what I was saying to you earlier aboutI was hoping that the women of Rutgers wouldn't allow all of this degrading talk about who they were to affect how they felt about themselves because nobody can make you feel badly about yourself.,INTERVIEWER, What do you make of your influence with books? That you can ...,INTERVIEWEE, Well it just started as a fluke. I was saying that I started out with a young intern who started the exact same day that I did Alice McGee. And her job was to sort of be a runner for me in the Beginning so she'd go get me pantyhose at the Walgreen's store and come back and bring lunch and that kind of thing. And Alice then I started paying her to be my publicist and then she moved up and became an associate producer producer. And Alice and I used to exchange books all the time and we would you know say what are you reading now what are you reading? And one day she said why don't we do this on TV? And I go it'll never work on television you know. America doesn't read and you can't talk about books on television. And she said what if we had a club. So that's how it all started. And I am surprised every time.,INTERVIEWER, And then you stopped it for a while.,INTERVIEWEE, I stopped it because I was overwhelmed trying to because somebody just saidan audience member just said to me the other day as I handed out the latest book "The Road" by Cormac McCarthy. Have you read this book?,INTERVIEWER, No.,INTERVIEWEE, I should have brought you that for your anniversary. You should read that book.,INTERVIEWER, "The Road.",INTERVIEWEE, Yes "The Road" by Cormac McCarthy. You know why? Because it's about a father and son at the end of time and fathers love this book.,INTERVIEWER, Well I'm a father.,INTERVIEWEE, So for youyou're a father all right. How's Chance?,INTERVIEWER, Chance and Cannon are both fine.,INTERVIEWEE, Nice.,INTERVIEWER, They're eight and seven now.,INTERVIEWEE, See. Yes you would have loved this book. Anyway so ...,INTERVIEWER, You'd be a great mother. INTERVIEWEE, I now feel like I am a mother Larry.,INTERVIEWER, OfOh.,INTERVIEWEE, I have 151 girls. I am a mother to 151 ...,INTERVIEWER, And by the way on that were there complaints that that school is too strict? Parents can't get to see their kids or something?,INTERVIEWEE, Well there was some complaints about it but I pay no attention to it. Pay no attention to that many behind the counter like in "The Wizard of Oz." Pay no attention to the man behind the door. There were two complaints. Two that ended up being blown out of Proportion. And I called the two parents and said to the two parents who were allegedly complaining that if you have a problem with the way we are running this school please feel free to come and get your daughters at any time because I'm not changing the rules because you don't like the rules. And they're complaining because there's no junk food. And I go there isn't and there's not going to be. And they're complaining because it took too long for them to get through security at the gates because the kidswhen they come to see their children I make you go through security with whoever you're bringing. I'm not changing that. And if you don't like that you can come and get your daughter any time you want. Feel free to do that. I'm not changing the rules. And they're complaining because we had a major problem with cell Phones cell phones. Some of the girlsyou know because some of the girlsyou can only come to my school if your parents make less than $10000 a year. No more than $10000 a year. So there's a range. Some children have families that make nothing and some make seven eight nine and almost 10. OK so some of those kids can afford cell phones and that's the first thing they all want is cell phones. And we had a rule in school that you cannot bring your cell phones to class. I cannot have the cell phones ringing in the classrooms. I said to the girls what should the rules be? And they said that we should not have the cell phones in class. And then several girls broke that rule. So now you know what I'm going to do? I'm going to take the cell phones away and that's what we did. So parents were complaining about that.,INTERVIEWER, Oprah and I were involvedand I haven't talked to her about it...,INTERVIEWEE, Nice.,INTERVIEWER, ...off the air or on in one of the deals dealing with a book.,INTERVIEWEE, What? INTERVIEWER, I had the author on you called in to say he was fine ...,INTERVIEWEE, Oh that thing that thing.,INTERVIEWER, That's called a grabber. Don't go away.,INTERVIEWEE, Oh that thing.,INTERVIEWER, We're back with Oprah on our 50th anniversary week. She is the kickoff guest.,INTERVIEWEE, I'm the kickoff guest.,INTERVIEWER, We had thatan incident. James Frey came on our show.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, He'd written a book called "A Million Little Pieces.",INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, It was one of the books you selected as your book of the month.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, Later people complained that it was fraud or he didn't do the things he said he did.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, At the end of the show when he was on being contrite you called in his mother was on with him.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, You said I stand by you.,INTERVIEWEE, I stand by you.,INTERVIEWER, The mother started to cry they grabbed his hands. It was one of the great moments on television. Headlines next day "Oprah Stands By." ,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, Next week "Oprah Annihilates James Frey.",INTERVIEWEE, I didn't annihilate him. You can even ask him. I didn't annihilate. At the end of that conversation on my show I said look I know I was tough on you but I had to be tough on you because you really disappointed me and so he understood that. And actually I called him a couple days later to see how he was doing.,INTERVIEWER, What's yournow in looking back.,INTERVIEWEE, Well it made me very wary of doing memoirs and so you will notice that since that time I've only chosen two memoirs. First of all I went a whole year because I had chosen Elie Wiesel's book.,INTERVIEWER, Great book.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes. And I chose "Night" because I so believe in Elie Wiesel and I know that everything that he had said in that book was true and you know knew that was true. So I felt that that was reallynot only did I love that book or wanted other people to experience it the way I had experienced it but also I could trust that it was the truth. And soand then I went a year and didn't choose a book because I was working for the school and just honestly didn't have time to read any other books. And then the next book I chose that I could trust was the truth was Sidney Poitier's book. And so ...,INTERVIEWER, Which was the next number one paperback?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes number one. So now I've moved on from memoirs because I don't knowyou know because a lot of publishersI was surprised to find that the publishers do not vet the stories or vet the books. And in the case of James Frey it hadn't been. So I was trusting the publisher you know.,INTERVIEWER, When you get a major publisher that's logical.,INTERVIEWEE, That's right.,INTERVIEWER, We all in this business trust the publisher.,INTERVIEWEE, I was trusting that the publisher knew that it was true or not and so that's why I felt so comfortable you know calling up at the end of the show. I couldn't find the number. What's the number what's Larry's number? How do we get through and there's only a minute left. So I called up and then later regretted that I had made that call. And I made it because I'm thinking well if it wasn't true the publisher would have said it wasn't true. They would have said it was fiction but that is not always the case.,INTERVIEWER, What's your barometer for picking the book? What does it have to do?,INTERVIEWEE, I just have toit's the same thing as anybody else who reads a book and says you know God I love that book.,INTERVIEWER, Don't you love five six books a month? I do. I love a lot of books.,INTERVIEWEE, I don't get a chance to read five or six that I love because I have read so many things that arethat I have to read for this show. And so in terms of like a good book that I feel I love it and at least a million other people love it I don't run into that very often.,INTERVIEWER, Do you. What ...,INTERVIEWEE, And I have to read every book. That's why I was saying the other day on my show a woman said to me did you read the book? How insulting is that? Did I read the book?,INTERVIEWER, So I've got to get "The Road.",INTERVIEWEE, "The Road" By Cormac McCarthy.,INTERVIEWER, When you're with a guestand this affects all of usand you either disagree or don't like them. Is that the hardest part of the day?,INTERVIEWEE, No. The hardest part of the day is paying the bills because I still pay all my bills and I look through all the ...,INTERVIEWER, You still write the checks?,INTERVIEWEE, I still write the checks. Yes I do.,INTERVIEWER, How about the guests that you don't like?,INTERVIEWEE, It doesn't matter. You know I am a very spiritually centered person. So there's very few people that I don't like and if I don't like you it's because your vibe is so negative that it's almost hard to even sit next to you. I tell you what's difficult isand I was going to ask you this question. When you're with a guest that you know is lying you know ...,INTERVIEWER, All you can do is all you can doyou try to go ...,INTERVIEWEE, You know they are skirting around the truth.,INTERVIEWER, And you try to go to the curb and get to it.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, Of course it's not a trial. ,INTERVIEWEE, No it's not a trial. It's not supposed to be a trial.,INTERVIEWER, You can't hold him in contempt.,INTERVIEWEE, Now have you ever done an interviewI know Katie is doing an interview tomorrow night OK have you ever done an interview where you know that you asked the wrong question and youthe person shut down.,INTERVIEWER, Oh yes.,INTERVIEWEE, That's happened.,INTERVIEWER, That's happened. Have you ever had ...,INTERVIEWEE, Yes that happened to me. Years ago I was ...,INTERVIEWER, I bet.,INTERVIEWEE, ... interviewing Sally Field and I asked her a veryand she was dating Burt Reynolds at the time. Was it Burt Reynolds?,INTERVIEWER, Yes Burt Reynolds.,INTERVIEWEE, OK she was dating Burt Reynolds at the time and I asked her an inappropriate question. I will say it's inappropriate so I won't repeat it. I asked her an inappropriate question and I saw the veil come down. And I was on live television and she basically shut down. So I learned from that experience. Don't ask a question that's going to put a person in a compromising position or an embarrassing position when you're on live television. They'll shut down on you and then where do you go.,INTERVIEWER, And then when they're shut ...,INTERVIEWEE, It's over.,INTERVIEWER, ...they don't come back.,INTERVIEWEE, They don't come back. They're not giving up anything for you.,INTERVIEWER, Back with more of Oprah.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, We're back with Oprah. Wee have an e-mail question for Oprah. When we announced you were going to be on someone sent an e-mail. ,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, From Adrian (ph) in Athens Georgia. "If you could go back in time and talk to yourself at age 12...",INTERVIEWEE, OK.,INTERVIEWER, ..."what one piece of advice or sentence of encouragement would you offer to the young Oprah?",INTERVIEWEE, Twelve.,INTERVIEWER, Twelve. What would you say?,INTERVIEWEE, We did this in my magazine. I'm not trying to promote my magazine but we did this asking your younger self. Gee 12 I wasthat was a very rough time for me. I would probably say like hang in there.,INTERVIEWER, It was a rough time?,INTERVIEWEE, It was veryyeah yes it was a rough time. Twelve 14 very rough time.,INTERVIEWER, Family rough?,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah family rough. I was being you know sexually abused at the time. I just recently saw for myself my mother had saved I don't have anything from my past but she saved a certificate from the SearsI mean like Sears & Roebuck charm school.,INTERVIEWER, You went to the ...,INTERVIEWEE, I went to the Sears & Roebuck charm school and I was 12 years old and I just saw papera clipping.,INTERVIEWER, You graduated?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes I graduated from the charm school and I saw a picture of myself and my goshI had on the cat-eye glasses and I am so unattractive. I am like one little ugly girl. You know I felt so bad about myself. That's why I wanted to go to charm school.,INTERVIEWER, The number one book in the United States now running for a long time is "The Secret.",INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, We have done some shows on it. You have done some shows.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes,INTERVIEWER, What do you make of this?,INTERVIEWEE, Well what I make of it is I was really very excited that this line of thinking this level of I call consciousness has reached the masses in such a way that that book could be number one. I was really very excited about it because basically the message of "The Secret" is the message that I've been trying to share with the world on my show for the past 21 years. The message is that you're really responsible for your life. You are responsible for your life. I have known thisI've known this since "The Color Purple." In 1985 I probably told you this story when I did "The Color Purple" but in 1985 I did "The Color Purple." Prior to that I had read the book Larry. This is when I got the secret thing but I didn't know it was called "The Secret." I read the book "The Color Purple" and then went out and got books for everyone else I knew and I was obsessed about this story obsessed about it. I ate slept thought all the time about "The Color Purple." I moved to Chicago. I get a call from a casting agent asking would I like to come and audition for a movie. I've never gotten a call in my life from anybody for a movie or anything like that. And I say is it "The Color Purple." And he says "No it's a movie called 'Moonsong.'" And I go well I've been praying for "The Color Purple." And I go to the audition and of course it was "The Color Purple." I audition. I don't hear anything for months. And I go to this fat farm and I think it's because I'm fat because I was about 212 pounds at the time. And I think I didn't get the call back because I'm so fat. And I am at this fat farm and I am praying and crying saying to God help me let this go because I wanted to be in this movie so much. I wanted it I wanted it I wanted it. I thought I was going to be in the movie. There were all these signs that I was should be in the movie. And I go to this fat farm and I'm praying and crying and as I'm on the track singing this song "I surrender all I surrender all all to thee my blessed savior I surrender all." I am singing that song praying and crying. A woman comes out to me and she says on the track it's raining and she says "There's a phone call for you. And the phone call was Stephen Spielberg saying I want to see you in my office in California tomorrow." Now what I learned from that that moment absolutely changed my life forever because I had drawn "The Color Purple" into my life. I didn't know Stephen Spielberg. I didn't know Quincy Jones who saw me in Chicago in 1984. He was there for a lawsuit that was being filed against Michael Jackson because he had been working on his "Thriller" album. And he saw me on "8:00 A.M. Chicago" and said "That's Sophia." Now I didn't know him. I didn't know anybody that had anything to do with that. But I knew that I had drawn that into my life and it changed the way I thought about my life forever.,INTERVIEWER, So you're not surprised at the success of "The Secret.",INTERVIEWEE, I'm thrilled for the success of "The Secret." I think that the message needs to go further because I think the mistake that was made with "The Secret" is that they tried tothey don't know who they arethat they tried to let that be the answer to all questions. It's not the answer. It's just one law. The law of attraction is one law. There are many laws working in the world. But it is very true that the way you think creates reality for yourself. There are other factors going on so it's not everything but you really can change your own reality based on the way that you think.,INTERVIEWER, Time flies. By the way don't forget "Oprah and Friends" on XM Satellite Radio. You're having fun with that?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes I'm having fun with that.,INTERVIEWER, They're going to have a special channel for Larry King for a week starting today.,INTERVIEWEE, Really?,INTERVIEWER, It started today. The Larry King channel it's XM-130. What are you?,INTERVIEWEE, I'm 156. XM-156. Does the 50-year anniversarywhat does it really mean? I mean I I know we're all celebrating you and...,INTERVIEWER, It mean I'm old. It means I've been around 50 years.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, I can't believe it.,INTERVIEWEE, Andwhat are you most impressed with how it's changed in 50 years?,INTERVIEWER, Oh what you mentioned before all those 200 plus countries.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, When I was a kid in Brooklyn...,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, ...I dreamed of being on the radio. Just if I could do Dodger games. That would be the world would be Dodger games.,INTERVIEWEE, Wow yes.,INTERVIEWER, No it was CNN my God.,INTERVIEWEE, Two-hundred countries.,INTERVIEWER, Moscow they watch.,INTERVIEWEE, Does anybody intimidate you?,INTERVIEWER, No I learned well (ph) because the host controls the show. You know that.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes yes yes.,INTERVIEWER, You're going to speak at Howard University.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes I'm going to speak. Yes I don't know what I'm going to say yet but I'll be working on it.,INTERVIEWER, Don't know what you're going to do yet.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes I don't know what I'm going to say.,INTERVIEWER, Anybody you want to interview?,INTERVIEWEE, You know the people that for me that I learned the most and they are the most memorable for me because obviously you interview celebrities I interview celebrities and celebrities are fun wonderful to have on if you can get them. But it's the real folks. Like I interviewed a woman a couple years ago. She had been hit by a drunk driver and burned alive in her car. Face completely burned off. Her name was Jackie (ph). And you know everybody talks the talk and I say a lot of this in my magazine about looking for your inner beauty. And it was a moment sitting with that woman Larry who had had her whole face burned off and her ears are pinned back andjust really. And she saidI asked her whether there were times she wanted to die and she said no I have too much to live for. And I thought my God that is walking the walk. You know that's not just you know verbalizing talking about it. And most recently I had a guy on who was in a big plane crash and heSingapore Airlines about six nine years ago. I can't remember how many years. But as he was leaving the plane he said all the bodies were on fire on the plane. And he looked back and he saw that auras were coming up out of the bodies up out of the flames and that he wasn't a religious person but he learned in that moment that he wantedand that some auras were brighter than others and that he said I want to live my life so that my aura is always bright. And so that kind of thing really impacts me.,INTERVIEWER, Are you happy?,INTERVIEWEE, On a scaleI just did a happiness show.,INTERVIEWER, Oh yes?,INTERVIEWEE, I am off the charts. I am off the charts.,INTERVIEWER, You ...,INTERVIEWEE, I'm off the charts happy.,INTERVIEWER, On a scale of 10 you're an 11. Are you? Are you an 11 on a scale of 10?,INTERVIEWEE, Probably 15.,INTERVIEWER, Whoa!,INTERVIEWEE, Yes I'm off the charts.,INTERVIEWER, You're off the charts.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, Oprah I know that one of your catch phrases is "what I know for sure.",INTERVIEWEE, Yes. Well may I say that that catch phrase came from the late Gene Siskel because I had been interviewed by Gene Siskel many years ago and he asked me at the end of the interview what do you know for sure? And I was so stumped that I went home and like three days later and I called him up and he goes the interview is over Oprah. I don't need to know now.,INTERVIEWER, Well what I know for sure ...,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, ...is this was a great hour.,INTERVIEWEE, Thank you.,INTERVIEWER, And I've been honored to have you...,INTERVIEWEE, Oh thank you.,INTERVIEWER, ...as our first guest of the week.,INTERVIEWEE, Thank you. Happy anniversary Larry.,INTERVIEWER, Thank you doll.,INTERVIEWEE, Really.,INTERVIEWER, Tomorrow night ...,INTERVIEWEE, Katie Couric ...,INTERVIEWER, Turns the table. ,INTERVIEWEE, ... turns the table. Yes.,INTERVIEWER, Tonight Jon Stewart counting down to hosting this Sunday's Oscar show where anything can happen. Making you laugh with all the latest news as only he can. We'll take your calls too. Jon Stewart for the hour is next on Larry King Live. It's a great pleasure to welcome Jon Stewart to our program. He's going to host the Academy Awards this Sunday night.,INTERVIEWEE, This Sunday? Oh gees.,INTERVIEWER, And he's here tonight kicking offare you nervous? You got to be nervous.,INTERVIEWEE, I'm always nervous. You're a huge star. You have very probing questions. I'm always nervous when I'mwhen I'm on your program.,INTERVIEWER, How about the Academy Awards?,INTERVIEWEE, Ah not so much. No I'm excited more than I am nervous. I know it seems to be portrayed as a bigger deal. Maybe I'm not understanding it.,INTERVIEWER, people that bomb.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes but I bombed in front of you know a lot of different audiences. This will just be the most famous audience that I bombed in front of. I bombed once so badly at Radio City Music Hall when they reopened and when I walked off stage Shirley Jones hugged me the Partridge Family mother. I walked off stage. I didn't even know her and she just did this oh and then I had to go and accept a hug from Shirley Jones.,INTERVIEWER, But when you're this bigfirst of all how did you get this?,INTERVIEWEE, It's a big event but...,INTERVIEWER, How did you get it?,INTERVIEWEE, I'm sorry?,INTERVIEWER, How did you get this offer?,INTERVIEWEE, Oh they called and I said sure. I'm not even sure they got out Academy Awards before I said sure. They said "Would you like to" and I said sure and that was it. It was actually quite simple. They called right around Christmas so it was very exciting for me. Besides you know Jews don't normally get presents around that time of year. Normally we just sleep in so it was kind of exciting.,INTERVIEWER, How are you approaching it?,INTERVIEWEE, With a workman-like focus a laser-like focus with energy with discipline. I get up around 5:00 usually pretty hammered and I roll over .,INTERVIEWER, You're revved up.,INTERVIEWEE, No I got a couple of my guys with me from "The Daily Show" we're out writing. I mean the truth is we've been doing "The Daily Show" for all the way up until just this week so I've kind of been focused on that. And at home my wife and I just had another baby so I've also been thinking about that. So you know this is a nice period for me to really be able to sit down and focus on it.,INTERVIEWER, Speaking of that you're newest baby is Maggie Rose (ph) right?,INTERVIEWEE, Newest baby you make it sound like a line of clothing.,INTERVIEWER, We havewe have a Republican and a Democrat.,INTERVIEWEE, Ah that is the sweetest.,INTERVIEWER, What better gift for Jon Stewart?,INTERVIEWEE, You know what there's nothing that a 3-week-old appreciates more than an ironic gesture.,INTERVIEWER, And it's cuddly.,INTERVIEWEE, Thank you. This isthis is lovely and it has a flag and oh look at that made in China hum. So it really does represent the parties. That's exciting. Is thatare you sure this is a donkey?,INTERVIEWER, It looks like a donkey. It's sort of weird-looking donkey.,INTERVIEWEE, It's a little bit of a weird-looking donkey and you got this from the CNN Gift Shop?,INTERVIEWER, No. I don't know where. The crew got it., INTERVIEWEE, Does CNN have a giftyou didn't get this?,INTERVIEWER, We have a gift...,INTERVIEWEE, Well thank you for the thoughtful gift that your crew picked up while you were getting spa treatments. I'm ashamed of you. This is reallythank you so much to the unpaid interns. When are you guys going to .,INTERVIEWER, Is it true are you picking the Oscar winners?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes. This year they're going to try something different is just right before the announcement I'm just going to write whatever name pops into my head on a card and that's who wins. It's very different this year because Price Waterhouse as you know was bought by a company in Dubai so the security at this year's Oscars is going to be handled by an Arab company.,INTERVIEWER, So in other words this will be a set up?,INTERVIEWEE, What will be a set up?,INTERVIEWER, The winners. You will know the winner before it's announced?,INTERVIEWEE, No no of course it's a very protected process and it's very secretive and no one can know. Actually no one does know untilI feel badly for the guy in the orchestra. Bill Conte has to learn all five songs depending on whether or not who's going to win. I'm hoping Terrence Howard wins. I just want to hear Bill Conte and the orchestra play "It's Tough out Here for a Pimp." I just want to hear how that sounds with violins. Have you been to the Oscars?,INTERVIEWER, I've never you know I've never. I go to the "Vanity Fair" party but I've never been to the Oscars. Oh George Clooney invited me to be his guest this year.,INTERVIEWEE, And I'm sure he meant that. I'm sure he did.,INTERVIEWER, I'm holding him.,INTERVIEWEE, What could happen? If it goes badly for me what could happen? Will they stop honoring film? Like what really is the huge jeopardy here? It's really just for me right?,INTERVIEWER, There's no jeopardy. The only jeopardy is you.,INTERVIEWEE, Except for me is that I will be scorned.,INTERVIEWER, I mean do you know that let's say Letterman had a bad time is that part...,INTERVIEWEE, And he seems to have bounced back. He seems to have done reasonably well.,INTERVIEWER, Yes I would say. ,INTERVIEWEE, Yes so I think thatand by the way have you ever watched that show like I have a DVD of it? He's hilarious. He's really funny on it. It's actually quite funny and theOprah thing that everybody always talks about he tagged it with "Oh and also I want to introduce you to my friend Keanu" and the place went crazy. They laughed like hell. So it's you know the lore of it is somewhat different than it seems the reality.,INTERVIEWER, You are very cool with this.,INTERVIEWEE, I'm sorry?,INTERVIEWER, You're very cool with this.,INTERVIEWEE, I'm excited. You know I feel like so you give up a homerun in the All Star game do you know what I mean? At least you got there. I have very low expectations for myself so this is one of those things that you know it has surprised me so far people's anxiety level for me. You know there'sI really have gotten a sense where people are like "Are you OK?" And I just think yes.,INTERVIEWER, Well you know why. You're not Hollywood. You're not...,INTERVIEWEE, Right.,INTERVIEWER, You're different.,INTERVIEWEE, But that's why I think the jeopardy is much less for me. What are they going to do bump me down from basic cable? How far lower? Where am I going to go public access? What can happen? This is the biggest stage I've ever been on. It's the grandest opportunity I've ever had. I just think it'sI vow to enjoy it.,INTERVIEWER, Are you going to have a spectacular opening?,INTERVIEWEE, Oh!,INTERVIEWER, A Billy Crystal kind of thing a dance a dance?,INTERVIEWEE, As you know I am a triple threat.,INTERVIEWER, Are you going to do something? Are you going to dance?,INTERVIEWEE, I'm going toI have been studying some of the openings. I've got a Gene Kellythat is going to blow you away. It's going to be aI'm sorry did I say Gene Kelly? I meant Gene Rayburn.,INTERVIEWER, That's too hip for them.,INTERVIEWEE, It's too hip for the room all right fair enough.,INTERVIEWER, All right let's move to some things. Jon Stewart will host the Oscars Sunday night.,INTERVIEWEE, It's going to be the most controversial Oscars ever. I would not be surprised if the whole country tunes in.,INTERVIEWER, Will you truthfully will you get into politics?,INTERVIEWEE, Sorry? You mean after I retire as a comedian?,INTERVIEWER, No will you get into politics Sunday?,INTERVIEWEE, Oh I'm sure there will be references and such like that but I'm notI'm not going out there you know looking to blow the place up. I want toI want to do a nice job. Really for the most part the pressure I feel is for the actors and actresses and people that are nominated and who are there and it's their big day and you don't want to screw up their wedding. You don't want to be the deejay going you know all right everybody let's play Celebrate. Where's my CD? You know.,INTERVIEWER, Have they given you any parameters like you can't say this?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes gigantic booklet.,INTERVIEWER, Really?,INTERVIEWEE, Terrible terrible restrictions on many things no adverbs. I don't even know where that comes from. Why wouldn't you want something that could help describe a noun or a verb or a...,INTERVIEWER, Any rules?,INTERVIEWEE, No they've been very cool. They do want to see the stuff beforehand.,INTERVIEWER, Like they haven't said don't messthey do?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes they said you have to do I think the quota was six gay cowboy jokes. Apparently every show that goes on from now until next February has to have six gay cowboy jokes including non- film award shows which I think is .,INTERVIEWER, I read somewhere you've only seen one movie the whole year.,INTERVIEWEE, No that's ridiculous.,INTERVIEWER, That's what it said.,INTERVIEWEE, "40 Year Old Virgin.",INTERVIEWER, That's the only one you saw?,INTERVIEWEE, Quite good. No I've actually seen quite a few and enjoyed them tremendously and I'm stunned at the quality of the nominees this year.,INTERVIEWER, We're back with Jon Stewart. All right what do you make of that story?,INTERVIEWEE, Now what story was that?,INTERVIEWER, The Cheney story?,INTERVIEWEE, It was obviouslythe fact that the guy was OK was the whole as far as for a comedian goes that's the whole reason you could sort of dine on it for a week. Obviously if the guy had been seriously injured or when he had the heart attack we downgraded it from pants wettingly funny to still pretty funny but there is a tinge of sadness. There is some melancholy. If he had died obviously it moves into Brechtian territory. Then it's not so funny unless sung.,INTERVIEWER, Do you hunt?,INTERVIEWEE, I'm sorry?,INTERVIEWER, Do you hunt?,INTERVIEWEE, I hunt in the most dangerous quarry of all Larry man. No I don't. I've never hunted. I held a gun once in a bar fight but I was behind the bar and an off duty cop got clocked and it was at anconcert. The bar that I worked at was City Gardens in New Jersey and I ended up with the guy's gun behind a bar and very heavy the gun and I realized right then I would never make a cop because I could never do this. If I had the gun it would be one of these there you go. But I can understand why it'swhy shooting things is interesting although not the wayapparently there's a thing that they do where it's not exactly like in the wild because they don't have that much time and the birds are raised in a pen and their wings are taken off and you know because it'sbecause the vice president travels obviously with you know doctors and a medical helicopter and the cast of "ER" or whatever the hell he's got with him So a real bird I'm sure would be like "Oh my God listen to that" and they'd be out of there so theythey hunt what we call quail tarts which are specially raised birds that hear noise and go "I'm going to go check that out" walk over and the vice president can just walk right up to them and either shoot them with his gun or hit them in the face with his hammer whatever he wants to do.,INTERVIEWER, Sport it's not?,INTERVIEWEE, It doesn't seem to be sport. It seems to be hunting for unbelievably rich busy people. I love the description too of the guy he shot was literally like a Bush pioneer who also runs you know his own country somewhere.,INTERVIEWER, CBS poll just out...,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, ...Bush 34 percent lowest rating he's ever had and Cheney 18 percent.,INTERVIEWEE, The 18 percent thing is you really have to think of this inlet's look at this just purely statistically. Four out of five dentists surveyed recommend sugarless gum for their patients who chew gum. So there is one out of five dentists who say "You chew gum? Ah why not put sugar in it?" These are not the best dentists OK that's 20 percent. He's not even getting all the dentists who recommend sugared gum. That's low. I think Dracula has a higher Q rating right now than the vice president.,INTERVIEWER, And the president 34?,INTERVIEWEE, Thirty-four percent isthat's a little bit shocking because I always thought he would never dip sort of below 40 percent. I felt like he sort of had this...,INTERVIEWER, Core.,INTERVIEWEE, He seems like he's a really good president for one very particular part of the country and they have really rallied around him and when you start to lose that support you know he's neverwhen you look at the vote how it breaks down it's you know 51 percent for Bush 49 percent for whoever the Democrat was but the Democrats have only like two or three percent of the power. The fact that Bush is having you know the base that he goes with erode I think that says a lot.,INTERVIEWER, What do you make of this Arab Emirate story and guarding the ports?,INTERVIEWEE, I'm trying to figure out how whoever is running the ports could inspect actually less than the five percent that are inspected now. I mean apparently they only inspect five percent of what comes in there so you don't know if you know when a ship comes in you don't know if it's unloading rattan chairs for Pier 1 Imports or Chinese sex slaves like nobody has any idea. So I'm not exactly sure what thatI know that it sounds bad. I know that if you know in America today it's as though somebody has stoked fear in this country. I don't know who that might have been but it appears that the country is poised to react let's say reflexively with a certain xenophobic zeal.,INTERVIEWER, But when you stoke fear why then would you have the people you are saying to be fearful of run your ports?,INTERVIEWEE, Because you forgot you had stoked the fear. I'm not so sure they're paying much attention to the speeches they gave three weeks ago. "We're at war." Then three weeks later. "I don't understand. What's wrong with the port deal?" You know it's as though when you're at war you know he put us on war footing. You remember that. And then he seemed absolutely shocked that anyone would complain that perhaps our ports might be run from foreign nationals although apparently most of them are. The more you look into it the more it seems like not a very big story but I think like everything people are reacting to the way that this administration does their business which is I really feel like Bush just is like Santa. I know who's naughty. I know who's nice. You have no reason to pay attention. No the Dubai guys are OK. These guys over here they're evildoers. These guys are OK. Don't look into it.,INTERVIEWER, We'll be right back with Jon Stewart. This Sunday night he will host the Academy Awards.,INTERVIEWEE, Sunday?,INTERVIEWER, We're back. You like Maher's work?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes that's a good joke. He's solid.,INTERVIEWER, We're all into him. OK. Jack Abramoff.,INTERVIEWEE, Abramoff apparently you know he's a...,INTERVIEWER, Pled guilty.,INTERVIEWEE, He's pled guilty. Let me tell you something. This is no wayhe's a guy. He's an Orthodox Jew who is running what is a corrupt lobby. This in no way reinforces any negative stereotypes that people may have had towards let's say Jews just a bad apple just a guy who happens to accept money from whoever comes for corruption and personal favors. I think it's good for us. I think it's good for the Jews.,INTERVIEWER, Good for the Jews?,INTERVIEWEE, Next question.,INTERVIEWER, And,INTERVIEWEE, What do you think? Have you ever had Abramoff? Every time a guys comes up...,INTERVIEWER, No I've never had Abramoff.,INTERVIEWEE, ...that isthat isthat they find out like Ken Lay like any of those guys everybody starts walking away like get away. Yes who was this Abramoff guy? Apparently he's the guy that literally financed the entire infrastructure for this whole K Street project for the entire sort of GOP renaissance in Washington.,INTERVIEWER, They all back off.,INTERVIEWEE, Everybody. Bush you know whenever that happens he did the same thing with Chalabi Abramoff "Yes I think I met him at a Hanukkah celebration. We lit a candle at it. I didn't remember his name. I think I shook his hand." I don'tand then there's like pictures with like the two of them naked in a sauna. You're just like what's going on around here? Why don't they ever own up? You know Chalabi Chalabi the name is somethingthen they show footage you know Chalabi is sitting directly behind Laura at the State of the Union address you know literally flicking her ear. I think I heard of him.,INTERVIEWER, Who in this administration fascinates you the most?,INTERVIEWEE, The American people for their just utter patience. And everybody it just seems like I just don't know what it's going to take. What else you know there is this wholemy mind has been blown just so consistently by this administration's insistence on their own competence without ever sort of delivering kind of any sort of evidence to that. I think at this point everybody just kind of rolls their eyes like ah those guys are at it again.,INTERVIEWER, Who do you see on the Democratic side of the ledger forging forth?,INTERVIEWEE, I like this guy John Kennedy since him not so much. No there's not I mean I don't really see anybody forging forth from there. I don't.,INTERVIEWER, Hillary?,INTERVIEWEE, Well certainly she'speople recognize her name and go "Hey that's that lady that was married to the president. Let's vote her in." You know I don't see anybody out there who has inspired. You know everybody thought Barack Obama was going to be when he came into Washington but you know the Senate seems like the place where smart people go to die like it does and you never hear from them again. So you know I'm not exactly sure. Do you have a favorite on the Democratic side? Do you haveI'm not even sure...,INTERVIEWER, Well the former governor of Virginia Mr. Warner seems very impressive.,INTERVIEWEE, Oh is that so?,INTERVIEWER, You don't know him?,INTERVIEWEE, No I don't know anyone.,INTERVIEWER, Mark Warner he's very...,INTERVIEWEE, Mark Warner OK I'll vote for him then.,INTERVIEWER, You don't have to vote for him.,INTERVIEWEE, No I'm fine. If you say it if you're vouching I'll vote. Is that a vouch?,INTERVIEWER, I'm not vouching. He's an impressive guy.,INTERVIEWEE, You gave him a vouch. Don't back off of the vouch. That's a vouch.,INTERVIEWER, I'm backing off of the vouch.,INTERVIEWEE, I'm voting for Warner.,INTERVIEWER, Frist.,INTERVIEWEE, Let's vote tomorrow. Frist please! He diagnosed Terri Schiavo as not being in a persistent vegetative state from like five seconds of a videotape. The guys a cardiologist "Ah she looks OK." I mean that's the whole thing. This country we can't even get the two political parties to agree on what reality is. You know the Democrats look at Terri Schiavo and they're like "Ah she's been dead for 20 years. Take her water away." The Republicans are like "Ah she's a couple of Pilates classes away from you know joining the Rockettes" like nobody can agree what reality is. I am so tired of both of these groups.,INTERVIEWER, Both.,INTERVIEWEE, I cannot tell you.,INTERVIEWER, Then what is left for you Jon?,INTERVIEWEE, What is left for me?,INTERVIEWER, If you're tired of both groups?,INTERVIEWEE, Hosting a basic cable show. That is what is left for me sitting every day and getting to rub my eyes and make stupid faces on videotape. That is all that is left for me. That is the catharsis that I live for.,INTERVIEWER, So in a sense you're happy over this.,INTERVIEWEE, No.,INTERVIEWER, This gives you fodder.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes I prefer not the fodder. I'm notwe're not the guys at the craps table betting against the line. I wouldwe'd make fun of something else. If public life if government suddenly became inspiring and moved towards people's better nature and began to solve problems in a rational way rather than just a way that involved political dividends we would be the happiest people in the world to turn our attention to idiots like you know media people no offense.,INTERVIEWER, So you don't want it to be bad?,INTERVIEWEE, Did you really just ask me if I want it to be bad?,INTERVIEWER, Yes because you...,INTERVIEWEE, What are youI have kids what do you think? Yes I don't want them to have any kind of aI want things to corrode to the point where we're all living in huts.,INTERVIEWER, Not all living in huts but generally comics political comics like things to go a little wrong don't have to be the end of the world.,INTERVIEWEE, Like things to go a little wrong like birdshot to the face of a guy that will survive.,INTERVIEWER, That's right.,INTERVIEWEE, Not like things to go wrong until it's like Mad Max every man for himself let's all ride around with machineguns on which seems to be the way that it's...,INTERVIEWER, You don't want Medicare to fail?,INTERVIEWEE, Are you insane?,INTERVIEWER, No.,INTERVIEWEE, You're literally asking me if I would preferyes Larry what I'm saying to you as a comedian I want old people to suffer old and poor people to suffer. That isthat iswhat we want iswhat seems absurd to me is the length that Washington just seems out of touch with the desires of Americans to be spoken to as though they are adults. I mean when you listen to Bush's speeches and I'm leaving the Democrats out because I honestly don't feel that they make an impact. They have 49 percent of the vote and three percent of the power. At a certain point you go "Guys pick up your game." But Bush you know the other day when he had the speech about us being addicted to oil he says those things as though you know he just thought of it and we're disagreeing with him like everybody's been saying that. Jimmy Carter said it I think in 1978. And he comes out "What people don't realize is we're addicted to foreign oil" and he's saying it like you're going "Get out of here." We're addicted. You don't get it people. You know he was the guy on the stump a few years ago making fun of hybrid cars because it wasn't manly.,INTERVIEWER, Our guest is Jon...,INTERVIEWEE, Andand his vice president did shoot a 78-year-old man in the face. Aaron Burr was the last vice president to shoot a guy in the face Alexander Hamilton.,INTERVIEWER, And that was a duel.,INTERVIEWEE, That was a duel based on personal integrity. This vice president thought a 78-year-old man was a bird. It happens. What are you going to do?,INTERVIEWER, We've declined as a society right?,INTERVIEWEE, I cannot tell you how many times I'll turn around and go "Grandpa" oh no it's a pigeon.,INTERVIEWER, Jon Stewart hosts the Academy Awards. You cannot tell...,INTERVIEWEE, Sunday?,INTERVIEWER, ...Sunday what might happen and he's not nervous.,INTERVIEWEE, I amI amI'm excited. I think it's going to bewe're going to have a lot of fun.,INTERVIEWER, That's Jon Stewart. He's our special guest live in Los Angeles tonight. He will host the Academy Awards Sunday night. We were talking before we take some calls that basically your schtick is the first ten minutes.,INTERVIEWEE, First of all don't call it schtick. That's insulting. I'm crafting things from whole cloth comedic bits to raise and lower peoples and to conduct an orchestra of humorous puns and such. Schtick please. Please sir. And schtick is a kinnish. No my friend you and your Yiddish. I won't have it. Mu punim won't pupick.,INTERVIEWER, Hi Larry how are you doing tonight? Jon it's a pleasure to talk with you. I have a question that refers back to your inference to the American people and how astounded you are that they don't react to the things that the Bush administration has done. Do you think the Dubai incident will incense the people enough to say hey Americans should be the only people protecting America or do you think this will just be another one where they blink and say look at what they're doing again?,INTERVIEWEE, First let me ask you a question. What the hell happened to Bode Miller? New Hampshire lady.,INTERVIEWER, I think he got a little bit too big for his ski boots.,INTERVIEWEE, Thank you I appreciate that. Now let's move on to the next thing. What was she saying?,INTERVIEWER, The American people they put up with all this.,INTERVIEWEE, First of all the American people it's like saying the media. There is no such thing as the American people. It's a collective ofI mean the whole thing is a melting pot a collecting of individuals. And will this finally push people over the edge to notice? I have no idea. I keep wondering. I keep wondering what it takes to get fired from this administration. It seems like literally the worse you do the bigger the medal you get. Like the more youif you goGeorge Tenet it is a slam-dunk they have weapons of mass destruction. I'm sorry. I can't think of a bigger mistake other than you walk in let's say when you had your heart attack and you go in and somebody says you have a broken leg . You had a heart attack. And then you would go doctor you get a medal. What's a bigger mistake than what he did and he was awarded with the Congressional Medal of Freedom. How does that fit in?,INTERVIEWER, Fresno California. Hello.,INTERVIEWEE, Look at you. You're beaten.,INTERVIEWER, Hello. Good evening Jon. I'm crazy about you Jon. Oprah Winfrey said that you're the real deal and I think that's the biggest compliment you can pay. My question was what was it like for you and your wife when Oprah came and spent the afternoon with you?,INTERVIEWEE, It was excellent. We had a wonderful time with Oprah. And when she left we looked underneath our chair in our living room. New car. Unbelievable. She passes them out like the way that in New York City they slip menus under your door. Literally as she was leaving our building she slipped a new car under everybody's door. She's like the candy man. I really like what she does. You can be on TV for a long time and lose your mind and it gets relentless. I think her ability to affect things is really kind of a remarkable ,INTERVIEWER, She is remarkable.,INTERVIEWEE,usage of your fame and wealth and I get a tremendous kick out of that.,INTERVIEWER, Manchester Vermont.,INTERVIEWEE, A lot of Manchesters tonight.,INTERVIEWER, Good evening Larry good evening Jon. My question is about "America: The Book.",INTERVIEWEE, Oh thank you.,INTERVIEWER, I teach history in a private school and I'm proud to say that I get a little wiggle room with what I use for resources and I'm actually going to incorporate a piece of the audio book into my teaching this week. And there's a chapter in the book towards the end about the future. And my question Jon is do you really think it's that bleak with the wholewith the indifference of the people and the distraction of the left/right paradigm we live in? And what can we do the people who try to make a difference?,INTERVIEWEE, First of all sir I love your teaching style. I love the enthusiasm with which you bring forth your love of history. I'm sure your students appreciate that as well. Wow! that was all. I didn't hear anything but paradigm. Did you?,INTERVIEWER, No.,INTERVIEWEE, He's talking about in the book we have a little thing on the future. The first thing I would say to a history teacher is we made half the stuff in that book up. So I would say that first and foremost. That to use any part of it in your class I don't even know if that would be appropriate to use in a fiction class.,INTERVIEWER, You even signed it to someone here stupid book.,INTERVIEWEE, I believe I did say stupid book and I stand by that. We're actually going tothe idea that he would use it in a history class I think is a mistake. I'm just saying.,INTERVIEWER, What do you think of Anna Nicole Smith? It's before the Supreme Court.,INTERVIEWEE, What are you doing to me?,INTERVIEWER, She's going to the Supreme Court to attend her hearing.,INTERVIEWEE, You want me to comment on this administration and now we move on to Anna Nicole Smith. You just gave me a brain fart. I can't move to that. What do I think? How is she getting to the Supreme Court?,INTERVIEWER, She's suing the estate of her ex-husband. It's a bankruptcy case.,INTERVIEWEE, And that's going to the Supreme Court?,INTERVIEWER, You didn't hear this?,INTERVIEWEE, I'm a very busy man.,INTERVIEWER, The Supreme Court has agreed to hear it because it's a bankruptcy case and therefore it regards the federal law. And it's her case. And she's filed a complaint and they're hearing her complaint. They've agreed to hear her complaint. And she is in court for the hearing.,INTERVIEWEE, We can't straighten out abortion law but they want to sit and have a couple of minutes with Anna Nicole Smith? They want to come in and find outdo you think this is a Trimspa thing? Do you think this is the justices they really want just a couple of minutes to go how did you have lose the weight? I mean look at Stevens over here? He's a bit of a tub. We talk to him all the time. He goes down to the Supreme Court gym. Can you give us any advice? Anna Nicole Smith is going to the Supreme Court? She's going to walk into the Supreme Court?,INTERVIEWER, Right.,INTERVIEWEE, Thank God that justice has a blind fold on her eyes because if she were to see that she would weep. If the justice statue saw Anna Nicole Smith she would literally gouge her own eyes out.,INTERVIEWER, You did it good. You said why did I go to that segue and you handled it great.,INTERVIEWEE, Is that true? I'm quite good.,INTERVIEWER, You're a comic.,INTERVIEWEE, Is that so?,INTERVIEWER, Yes.,INTERVIEWEE, Thank you. I should host the Oscars.,INTERVIEWER, And he will this Sunday night.,INTERVIEWEE, Sunday?,INTERVIEWER, What do you make by the way before we take the next call of listening in on phone calls for national security without ,INTERVIEWEE, Well I love the idea when they say if al Qaeda is calling you we want to know. Yes I think that sounds pretty reasonable. The problem is they don't sayagain it's like everything else. They say trust us everything's fine. Yet they've shown no real credibility. Honestly all of this is credibility issues. If they could assure credibility and trust with the people I think the people would be far more willing to trust their secretive nature. But to just come out at this point in the game and go we're listening to phone calls but it's reallyto tell you about it would put the whole operation in jeopardy the war on terror.,INTERVIEWER, Hi. I just have to tell you Jon you are the smartest funniest man on TV and I just go to sleep every night with a smile on my face.,INTERVIEWEE, I'm sitting right next to Larry.,INTERVIEWER, My question is does your wife find you hilarious.,INTERVIEWEE, You know living with someone for ten years the magic of my hilarity wears off.,INTERVIEWER, She doesn't laugh?,INTERVIEWEE, No she does. She's got a great sense of humor. But you know how it is. It's regular life. We don't sit and do spiel at the table. I say how is Maggie. We talk. But I hope she thinks I'm pleasant to be around.,INTERVIEWER, Is she out for the awards your wife?,INTERVIEWEE, No. She's going to come out right before the show but I'm outshe's back home.,INTERVIEWER, How's the new baby?,INTERVIEWEE, Great. Doingshe's great. Doesn't say a lot.,INTERVIEWER, And does Nathan Thomas who is 19 months old ,INTERVIEWEE, He's 19 almost 20 months.,INTERVIEWER, Does he like having a little sister?,INTERVIEWEE, He likes her very much unlessthere's only one thing he doesn't really like and that's if Tracy or I touches her. Or goes near her. Or mentions her name. Or thinks about the baby. Other than that I think he's bearing up very very well. He loves her. He calls her Ghee (ph) and gets very excited. You know what's interesting he is very excited and will run in her room but doesn't know what to do once he gets in there. Then he looks at her and it's little and he doesn't know what to do.,INTERVIEWER, And it's some difference from boys to girls let me tell you.,INTERVIEWEE, Is that right?,INTERVIEWER, Night and day.,INTERVIEWEE, What would be the difference?,INTERVIEWER, Just ain't the same.,INTERVIEWEE, So you're suggesting that boys are different than girls?,INTERVIEWER, I am suggesting that. As babies.,INTERVIEWEE, Interesting. Interesting. Are you suggesting maybe one has I don't know a penis? And the other perhaps not so much?,INTERVIEWER, That's one of the things.,INTERVIEWEE, Interesting.,INTERVIEWER, Hello. I was wondering regarding the cultural war we have between Republicans and Hollywood how Jon feels this year's crop of nominees and the films that Hollywood chooses to celebrate is that Hollywood thumbing its nose at Republicans or does it give kind of a vindication to the Republican party and possibly allow some backlash because the Hollywood finding a time of censorship becoming a real issue again could it hurt them?,INTERVIEWEE, I think that's a good question and it's a nice thing for the media to dissect but I'm not so sure how real it is. There's this idea that there are Republicans and Hollywood and there's such a thing as Hollywood and such a thing as Republicans and they're locked in a culture war. I just don't know what that is. That strikes me as much more of a method for pundits and politicians to whip up excitement and votes and fear than it is a real thing. Hollywood is notthere's this idea that there exists some sort of underground political Hollywood mockenation (ph) machine. Hollywood wantsthey're not red they're not blue they're green. They want money. It's a business like any other business. You get a"Passion of the Christ went well." Great replace Jesus with a talking lion. Narnia. Done. This idea that they're thumbing their nose at the country. They wantwhat do you think they're just putting movies out because they don't want people to go to. I'm going to put this out because you know what this is really going to make Iowa mad and I don't want them going anywhere near this thing.,INTERVIEWER, Let's check in with Anderson Cooper at the top of the hour.,INTERVIEWEE, Is he crying again? Did something happen? Now you're just being cruel. Now you're just being cruel.,INTERVIEWER, The new movie "Doogal" in which our guest Jon Stewart plays the evil wizard Zeebad. Jon's character Zeebad is now one of McDonald's happy meal toys. So in the same week that he hosts the Oscars he's a happy meals toy. In fact we have it right here. It fell off.,INTERVIEWEE, Boy if that isn't a metaphor for what's going down with that flick.,INTERVIEWER, There it is folks.,INTERVIEWEE, I think it goes the other way.,INTERVIEWER, Fix it. Fix Zeebad.,INTERVIEWEE, All right. Here you go. What you do is you do this you twist it up and then you go and then you stare at it and think about your own sadness.,INTERVIEWER, Did you like doing that?,INTERVIEWEE, Did I? Like?,INTERVIEWER, Like.,INTERVIEWEE, It's easy. You know you go into a room and they put lines in front of you and you read it. And then after you read a line they'll come out and go can you sound angry on that one? And then you do it again and then they go yeah that sounded kind of angry.,INTERVIEWER, Did you see a picture of the character you were playing?,INTERVIEWEE, No I did not. It was a movie already. It was a movie in England. I was under the impression that this was a foreign film that we were sort of redoing in an American version.,INTERVIEWER, It was a movie?,INTERVIEWEE, Right. But it was called "The Magic Roundabout" I think and it was a British film. So there actuallyit was already in English just with British accents. So what they did is they got American actors to then do and like put in pop culture references for America. It is in no way a cynical undertaking to make money. It's an art form. I think this is going to be the new wave. I think they're going to nowyou're going to see "Toy Story" redone in England with British people and...,INTERVIEWER, Do you know that next year you might be nominated?,INTERVIEWEE, I can assure you Larryand I feel pretty confident in saying thisthat next year I will not be nominated except for perhaps a Razzie. But I really don't feel that an Oscar. Maybein fact I can almost confidently state that...,INTERVIEWER, Goldie Hawn told us the other night that you were terrific in "First Wives Club" and they cut you out.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes. I was so good that they felt it would shame the rest of the movie to have my scenes in it. Yes it wasI wasI played her boyfriend and apparently they felt that that was not inherently part of the storyline.,INTERVIEWER, Yes.,INTERVIEWEE, And so she broke up with me before the movie started. So my role was not there.,INTERVIEWER, Kaput. Were you downtrodden? Were you hurt?,INTERVIEWEE, I really feel like I have gotten to this weird place where rejection like or bombing or things like that is kind of like it's a good kind of pain. Like you get a shot to the ribs sometimes and you go eh I'm alive you know what I mean? Like it doesn'tit doesn'tyou get to a certain baseline where you feel confident in your ability to do that tiny little thing that you do. And the other stuff that you've been allowed to do is sort of gravy and if it doesn't work out that's really all right.,INTERVIEWER, Yes.,INTERVIEWEE, Most people don't realize you have legs.,INTERVIEWER, That's right. They only see me sitting.,INTERVIEWEE, I'd always assumed that for the past 10 years they just brought you in on some sort of cart. And it was just from here on up and the rest of it is just some sort of auger-based fluid thing that was keeping you going. So to see you move like that is reallyit was quite impressive.,INTERVIEWER, So that was the moment of zen.,INTERVIEWEE, That was our moment of zen.,INTERVIEWER, Should I look at it as having made it?,INTERVIEWEE, No you should look at it as something denigrating and absolutely beneath your status as an icon. Now did thatwas that enjoyable? You really have some moves there.,INTERVIEWER, Yeah I did. I enjoyed it.,INTERVIEWEE, Do you know how to dance? Do you know how to do any of those like cha-cha or any of that kind of stuff?,INTERVIEWER, Not really. I'm faking it.,INTERVIEWEE, Are you really?,INTERVIEWER, Yeah. I mean I'm doing moves but I don't know what I'm doing.,INTERVIEWEE, What about joining that show? What about doing "Dancing With the Stars" or "Skating With the Stars" or "Quail Hunting with the Stars" whatever the next thing is going to be?,INTERVIEWER, I don't think I could handle that.,INTERVIEWEE, Here's what I want to see. "Heart Surgery With the Stars." Just put a guy out there maybe a guy you used to see on TV in the '70s that you love and Eric Estradalet them work with a cardiologist. Let them go in there doyou know how many people would tune in to see the guy from "Chips" do a heart transplant?,INTERVIEWER, Thank you Jon. Good luck Sunday.,INTERVIEWEE, Sunday?,INTERVIEWER, Sunday!,INTERVIEWEE, I'm excited. It's always fun to be here.,INTERVIEWER, This album um—like when I when I first heard it and the more I hear it I feel like the only like appropriate question to ask you after listening to it is are you okay? Like is something wrong? Like like it's like gut-wrenching. It's both beautiful—it's very beautiful—but it's like parts that hurt a little bit you know what I mean?,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah it's—man I was like... 'Cause for Cherry Bomb I purposely was like "I don't wanna get personal at all. Like I'mma just make songs. This is all just this is a song." And in this one I was like "Alright let me write down every feeling.",INTERVIEWER, Oh you started with emotions?,INTERVIEWEE, Just—just a lot of them was just asking questions. A lot of the songs just have questions it's just like "How am I feeling today? Fuck what if I go poor again? What if it doesn't work?" And then that's how a lot of the songs just happened just me kind of just asking these quest—answering these questions like so...,INTERVIEWER, But it's speaking to like a mood you were in. Like—like you recorded this one when did you...,INTERVIEWEE, Um mostly 2016—like I started to the end of 2015. A lot of spring summer 2016 and then a lot of fall,INTERVIEWER, What were you listening to? Like—,INTERVIEWEE, Um...,INTERVIEWER, Like watching and listening to?,INTERVIEWEE, Pop music. I love—I was like listening to pop structure. Uh kinda just what like Max Martin was doing and really getting into what what Pharrell and Justin was doing—,INTERVIEWER, Yeah...,INTERVIEWEE, And um just noticing just hooks. I uh—hanging out with Travis Taco. I went to the club with him and just seeing what people how people reacted to certain—,INTERVIEWER, You never go to clubs!,INTERVIEWEE, I hate 'em. But when I would go I would just study "Oh that that bass drop" or "Oh that girl loves that part." Just like "Okay I want to have a song that has that feeling." So I kind of was like okay. I wanna see—challenge myself and try to make a few songs that's not like "Uh rappity-rappy" or super distorted I was like... Last night I went to—me and Lionel went to like a house party and they they all the songs they were playing—"Señiorita" by Justin "Tell Me" by Total "Frontin'" by P—like all these house partying songs. And "See You Again" came on and it's full of black people that for sure go to clubs and they were in there like singing the lyrics and I was like "Oh shit I've always wanted that.",INTERVIEWER, To just have black people... dance...,INTERVIEWEE, I I did it. Yeah yeah! I was so hyped and I was—we were playing Jenga and I was being cool about it but inside I was like "Oh shit—",INTERVIEWER, It's funny because I guess I wouldn't have uh like thought about how much like pop is you know influenced in the album because because of like the subject matter. Like a lot of it is so heavy. That's why I was just wondering were you in like a place of just like...?,INTERVIEWEE, Well uh you gotta feed you put the—some people old people say you put the medicine in like the uh the candy—,INTERVIEWER, The applesauce,INTERVIEWEE, —Or the applesauce whatever so... Like with "Mr. Lonely" I was like "Aw dude I want to write the saddest song I could possibly write and see people go crazy and like dance to it" it's that. And at shows that song is insane and it's the saddest song I've ever wrote,INTERVIEWER, Yeah it really is—and you dance—I mean it's so hard it's so hard and like the greatest like bridge ever! What was that—what was that? I don't know if we—I mean I'm just gonna kind of jump into various songs—but like what what was like specifically that like... why that transition? Like why did you think that was like needed a transit—like was it like it for emotional like were you trying to create different moods?,INTERVIEWEE, So "911" and "Mr. Lonely" originally was uh a different song kind of together. It was this jazz take I had that was super triumphant and just sounded grand and a lot of those lyrics was uh... was in that song and I just took 'em and just placed them on "911" and then took the verse and placed it on "Mr. Lonely" and added some stuff. And "911"—the version that came out is the 25th version it had...,INTERVIEWER, Wait the 25th version? You did 25 versions of that song?,INTERVIEWEE, It was 24. The first version was over an interlude song that Tony Toni Toné had. I looped it sang over that liked the hook that I put there made 30 beats for it. It's—and the versions aren't just different type of lyrics it's literally like... different beats different melodies all that,INTERVIEWER, A completely different vibe?,INTERVIEWEE, Made that took the beat from the fashion show I did reworked that. Took the lyrics from the original "Mr. Lonely" and like implementing it in that and like so the original "Mr. Lonely" it's like uh...,INTERVIEWER, Yeah yeah...,INTERVIEWEE, Right yeah. That's in the last version of "911"...,INTERVIEWER, So you kept that based on the previous you just-,INTERVIEWEE, Exactly so I took it from this jazz song and I was like "nah I want them to groove to this shit" so I put it on that,INTERVIEWER, I actually always wondered why that bit repeat-,INTERVIEWEE, Well yeah it just 'cause it was from it was it was from the bass of the other one but when I put it there and drop the beat people I was like "oh people are gonna love saying this." And if you see that shows I don't even say it I just put the mic and the whole -ten thousand people: " nothing nothing nothing." And I'm like I figured it out and I-,INTERVIEWER, You figured out—that that feeling that you want the feeling of just everybody really connecting with it but wait- specifically the bridge on that- what was like-,INTERVIEWEE, Oh oh what the "chirp chirp" part?,INTERVIEWER, I say bird- but like which is the most one of the most addictive things-,INTERVIEWEE, I ain't made that I remember I made that and it was just the beat and I remember stopping like "I made the bridge that I've always wanted to make. Lonny came by-or Frank however people know him- and he came by and I played it for him he's like you let me go in there Just try something he just started making phone noises and it worked out so perfectly and we was like "alright" and-,INTERVIEWER, was it longer?,INTERVIEWEE, no that part I'm just giving n*ggas eight bars of these chords just so they could want it so they could replay it and left it at that,INTERVIEWER, How did you balance out and this is kind of for the whole album your love of chords with-you always talk about and you always say "n*ggas don't want chords" and that's all you're obsessed with. It's just everything is specific and just-,INTERVIEWEE, I just Want chords and melodies,INTERVIEWER, Yeah. and was it like a battle- cause the whole album has chords,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah I fucked up-well I didn't fuck up but Cherry Bomb was an album full of bridges and shit going everywhere so I was like let me for this album specifically add all the chords I like but do it in a way that they can digest. So Mr. Lonely has some of the prettiest chords on the album but I kinda hid it behind the hard drums and the fast paced rap but if you really listen it's really fucking pretty- Thank you. And I was like I'm definitely gonna-just try to hide it in those and stuff. And 911 even the uh "call me some time." I was listening to Gap Band and I was like damn these are simple chords and I love the melody let me try to implement it in this and make it as simple as possible but it still gives me that feeling. So the part where I was like "fuck it I'mma go crazy I right before Steve Lacy's part when it goes back to the hook and it's like: "dun dun dun dun dun" and I was like I'mma go on my Jill Scott shit and that's my favorite part of that song just cause it just-,INTERVIEWER, It has all the chords that you love,INTERVIEWEE, Exactly,INTERVIEWER, Umm do you wanna...,INTERVIEWEE, You could cut it now,INTERVIEWER, "I can't even lie..." Where does the..,INTERVIEWEE, I can just imagine a n*gga in a wife-beater on Valentines Day like in the hood and like-,INTERVIEWER, Is he talking to his friends or in the mirror-,INTERVIEWEE, I don't know who he's talking to but it's a quick shot like "I can't even lie I've been lonely as fuck n*gga" just being honest with his homies or something and I was like man that would be really funny to chant. But it's the perfect set up for when that song comes on. It set's you up for like what's 'bout to happen. It's honest but it's right here and they go crazy when they-,INTERVIEWER, It's like so sad it's hilarious. It's like there a group of n*ggas chanting-,INTERVIEWEE, And that's Rocky. That's Rocky yelling that. That's Q I think that's Wyatt that's Lionel that's Jasper-,INTERVIEWER, Alright Foreword is ah- ok first of all that tempo is very weird. It's like a really weird tempo that you found was it kind of just like a challenge?,INTERVIEWEE, Well so that's a loop from this band called Can. I've always been into krautrock its like- it was a sound that was very European like Eastern Europe and you got like Can The Silver Apples even Soft Machine which was this really proud jazz band that took influence around that time. And it's kind of what Portis Head listens to for influence and it's something I've always liked because it's just so weird and just- this weird drum patterns and these haunting bass lines and that's a song that they had and everytime I played it I would just rap over it. And I was like fuck it I'mma loop it add these-,INTERVIEWER, Is it hard to rap over just the-,INTERVIEWEE, Not actually It's actually just the "one two three four" but the pockets that they would use makes its sound like this weird push and pull back thing,INTERVIEWER, Yeah it feels like your on something you know what I mean? Just kinda pulls. Yeah and its like- that pocket is such- the pace of it when you're rapping over it is you do a little bit faster than I would expect. Like a little bit more- why why that song first? Why that mood though first? Where you trying to set a-?,INTERVIEWEE, I remember making it like "this need to be the first song." Just go in just so you can see where I'm at in my head and I remember writing that verse fully like.... "how much shit can I buy till it gets boring" like "how many jumps can I do on a bike until I'm over it and on to the next thing." And every answer that I had went to the next question like "was it ever enough.",INTERVIEWER, it almost sounded it was so existential and contemplative and it almost sounded suicidal especially the "if I'm going and don't come back"- do you know what I mean? It was so dark its-,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah yeah yeah. That was the end question like "damn what if I died? What happen? And that's kinda what it was and just to set the tone of like that's where I'm at. And it's not depressed-I'm not depressed at all. A lot of people mix up depression with self awareness. Someone was like "dude this album is depressing" and I was nah I never said I was depressed. I'm lonely but I'm having the most fun of my goddamn life. But that song kinda sets that tone,INTERVIEWER, Ok I mean if you're considering death but it's not from a depressed sad state is it from a state of like "alright I've got something to prove" cause it almost seems like you had a thing to prove on this album. I don't know to yourself or like-,INTERVIEWEE, Well a lot of people do stuff for the conversation of when they're dead. Like hopefully when I die people can say "oh he-this this and this" I leave a good discography behind but-,INTERVIEWER, Yeah I like to start with every project I like to start from death and work backwards,INTERVIEWEE, Exactly,INTERVIEWER, It's just like we're all gonna die someday,INTERVIEWEE, I just knew that if this album wasn't good I would be fucked. That's how I felt. And some people would disagree but I'm like man I'm nothing right now,INTERVIEWER, You felt like that coming off of Cherry Bomb?,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah yeah yeah cause everyone hated it except for like real music lovers who care about drums- like I opened a rap album with a rock song. Most n*ggas was like "uh." And then "Buffalo" comes and you can barely hear what I'm saying and then "Pilot" comes on and it's this 80's music and they're out cause they want rap. Then "Run" comes dun dun and then "Find Your Wings" comes and they're like "this is chill" and then Cherry Bomb comes and just punches them-so they're out and a lot of people didn't know how to take it so- But "Find Your Wings" and stuff felt so- I don't even know if I mean lyrically I mean sonically going back to your love of chords and stuff like that and you would on Cherry Bomb" it seems like you would have chords and distort it like it was you were always running from it and covering it up so that-saying it's your most personal album removed from the subject matter it feels that way like sonically Yeah I fully get that yeah. never thought that,INTERVIEWER, It just feels like a real- Okay so the sadness of Foreword that goes into almost the like- I'm going to say almost this cockiness of "Where This Flower Blooms." Do you feel like you were accepting yourself?,INTERVIEWEE, So its a lot of things-and I don't wanna take credit-that I was doing that people were like what is he doing and then two years later it's what everyone's doing whether it's the way videos are done or these stupid pop-up things or whatever and I'm not taking credit but I was doing that and no-one ever puts me on these lists or respects me in the sense that I wanted. So I was just and that's why that line is like: "Ain't nobody fucking with T but that just may be my ego but don't be too cool" because I may freeze and I'm stuck in this egotistical mindset and I never move forward and that's how n*ggas freeze to death but that "ice shit weighs a ton water your garden my n*gga and stunt." I got a flower chain made with all these different things and that's what I was talking about but I was like fuck these n*ggas keep doing my shit uh and "tell these black kids they can be who they are"-,INTERVIEWER, That's one of my favorite lyrics is just "tell these black kids they can be who they are",INTERVIEWEE, Dude right!,INTERVIEWER, Like it's one of my favorite- you had another lyric like that on Cherry Bomb that was just like "the world is yours little n*gga" like "my little n*gga the world is yours." Like I love that- like it's a similar thing like tell these black kids they can be who they are. Where you saying that to you or the people you see...?,INTERVIEWEE, I was saying that to me to but it uh it's no-one saying that to kids that look like me or anyone that looks like me. We had this conversation just wanting to snowboard when I was 12 but someone was like "oh that's white people shit. Black people don't do that." No you don't do that don't put a damper on me and tell me what I can a can't be just because of the way everyone else was that's my same color. And I just feel like I just wanted to tell them like "be you"-,INTERVIEWER, Who you are is such the alternative of the expectations are placed on like a young black guy growing up. Like you're influenced by kind of everything kinda all cultures so do you think you accepted that by yourself through your music,INTERVIEWEE, I knew who I was at like 12,INTERVIEWER, I think you rapped maybe 28% on the album. It's like so-,INTERVIEWEE, My goal for this album was to shut the fuck up and let the all feature be the leader. "Yes Rex here sing for two minutes before I come in with an 8 bar on 'Boredom' and then I'll have another 8 bar but I wanna shut up and just let the string section be 2 minutes at the end.",INTERVIEWER, "Boredom" I think-I found out about it this morning- "Boredom" right now to me is like your "Billy Jean.",INTERVIEWEE, Really?,INTERVIEWER, It really is kind of a- seeing people connect with that song... That song influenced... I think I called you and said if I don't know this song is creating an emotion for me or if it's like the soundtrack to something I already feel. Like that's how powerful I think it is,INTERVIEWEE, Well I wrote that literally it was a 5 pm on a Saturday laying on my back looking so bored. It was nothing to do no-one was hitting me back Jasper was in the other room bored out of his mind but I didn't see him the whole day my room was warm as hell because I like the heater on and there was nothing to eat but dry cereal and I'm sitting thinking "what the fuck am I going to do?" I literally wrote that verse in 10 seconds cause again it was these questions and these legit feelings of boredom that I was having. And it was weird to me 'cause it's like... I'm in a tax bracket where I can go do whatever. I have all these cars I can go drivebut I have nowhere to go and I'm just bored. And it was just confusing to me 'cause it's like-,INTERVIEWER, You don't understand how you could possibly,INTERVIEWEE, How the hell I could be bored when its... but there was nothing to do at the moment. So I was like fuck it I'm gonna write a song about it,INTERVIEWER, Jasper has to listen to that song and be like "fuck you n*gga I was right there",INTERVIEWEE, I wrote the song over the chords of "God Bless the Child" by Stevie Wonder. I figured out the chords looped it and had it just playing for hours in my room. And I wrote the verse which was like a 40 bar verse originally but I cut it in half 'cause I was like the hook needs to come back. So at the end of the first verse it's like "I'm... bored." I did that right when we was editing 'cause it went to the end of the verse it was like originally "I'm bored and getting desperate. Phone is not" It went straight to a different verse and it was a different pocket but I cut it because I was like I need to put the hook back in here 'cause I don't wanna hear myself,INTERVIEWER, Yeah 'cause it's a weird chunk just "I'm... bored. Find some time!",INTERVIEWEE, Uh huh. So I added that right when we was editing finishing I was like "No no no fuck that put the hook. Imma change the second verse a little bit and like so the pocket is easier to rap so everyone could say it." 'Cause it was too rapitty you know and I was like nobody wanna hear this deep ass voice rap for that long; let me shut the fuck up and do a hook so all the white girls at Coachella can sing this shit And I'm not lying doing festivals you realize white people love singing along to shit That's why the fucking Boredom is two minutes of just this like...,INTERVIEWER, When you perform this album live you start on Where This Flower Blooms usually. Is it a longer intro?,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah yeah yeah so... I wanted this album to sound like a Disney score. Just like very magical. My perfect little indie movie and fucking...,INTERVIEWER, Sound like the album cover looks,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah sound like the album cover looks like. But it turned into you know what it turned into. Where This Flower Blooms had this very beautiful longer intro I shortened it a bit but it sound like the beginning of a movie,INTERVIEWER, It's sweeping and...,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah I start the shows with that because it's like bringing them into my world and then it drops and gets crazy but... yeah,INTERVIEWER, How long did you why did you trim it and not just go-,INTERVIEWEE, I just wanted to cut the fucking fat. I wanted this album to be no longer that 45 minutes. And I think we hit 45:36 or 46 minutes and I was like okay cool. I just want it to be short and get to the point and yeah,INTERVIEWER, You were talking about questions and how every song is sparked by a... thing. [stammering] My favourite sequence of this of these songs but... uh Pothole is inspired by something your mom said to you. Is that like...,INTERVIEWEE, A long time ago she was like "yo some people just aren't really as loyal or close to you as you think." And I'm always like "shut the fuck up like what the fuck are you talking about?" Sometimes moms know best and I had to find out on my own like oh wow she wasn't wrong about that person. And I kind of wrote that verse like: "My mom told me blah blah blah." And uh...,INTERVIEWER, So you singing that more? You started singing that more,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah and even like I did it in the car like I drove back to the points where she told me specifically. Like when you make three lefts it makes it right. So like I triple left tryna double back. And the streets are filled with clues that she told me,INTERVIEWER, And that's great that some of your best,INTERVIEWEE, But how I ain't notice that. And I see some familiars I see some people I knew stuck in the cul-de-sac. I pull up get out "what up" I wanna help you. But what you want for some people they don't want for themselves. So do I stay here and try to figure it out or do I go and traffic is picking up? And if I don't leave now and get on my path and do what I need to do Imma be stuck and,INTERVIEWER, We're having a lot of fun with Snoop Dogg tonight. What a great guest to kick into the weekend. What a talent too and what a good guy. He's a good guy the Snoopthe Snoopster.,INTERVIEWEE, Larry I want to give you something here my new headphones. You know I make headphones too? These are the by Snoop Dogg so whenever you listen to that Frank Sinatra and Sam Cooke you can enjoy your music heavily.,INTERVIEWER, You make headphones now?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, Thank you Snoop.,INTERVIEWEE, Well thank you.,INTERVIEWER, I love this. I like the design too.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes sir. That's,INTERVIEWER, What's with you and the Los Angeles Lakers?,INTERVIEWEE, I've been a Lakers fan since the early '70s. I grew up loving Magic Johnson Kareem Abdul Jabbar and Chick Hearn. I had a chance to meet Chick Hearn ,INTERVIEWER, A great announcer.,INTERVIEWEE,and to work with Chick Hearn and I mean I'm just a die hard Laker. I love them to death. They can't do no wrong to me.,INTERVIEWER, You go to every game?,INTERVIEWEE, I go to as many games as I can when I'm in town. I just love to support them. If I'm not at the game I'm at home watching them on Prime Ticket you understand? We'll either watch them on Channel 9 KCAL.,INTERVIEWER, Do you ever go on the road with them?,INTERVIEWEE, I've been on the road with them before. When they won their championship in New Jersey I was right there on the floor when they did that.,INTERVIEWER, Did you ever play ball?,INTERVIEWEE, I played football and basketball as a youngster coming up on the east side of Long Beach. And I took it to a level that I thought itit was the highest level that I thought I could take it to. So I never wanted to play high school or the next level. I went to the level that I thought I was just playing.,INTERVIEWER, Did you go to a high school?,INTERVIEWEE, I went to high school but I didn'tI didn't never try out for high school sports. I was more into trying to create this music thing. I had aa niche for it and I really wanted to stick to it.,INTERVIEWER, You were always a music guy?,INTERVIEWEE, Always a music guy/comedian/class clown.,INTERVIEWER, Why the sunglasses?,INTERVIEWEE, So you can see what I'm saying. But I mean I can take them off.,INTERVIEWER, Well yes but it's part of your persona right?,INTERVIEWEE, At times.,INTERVIEWER, Do you design those too?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes you know I got to have my flavor. You see that matchbook with the headphones? That's that flavor that paisley.,INTERVIEWER, Oh yes yes the paisley stuff.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes that's what I do. That's that Snoop Dogg flavor Larry.,INTERVIEWER, What don'twhat have we donewhat haven't you done you'd like to do?,INTERVIEWEE, I'd like to start a chain of Snooper-markets.,INTERVIEWER, Selling what?,INTERVIEWEE, Every ,INTERVIEWER, Groceries?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes groceries. Anythingeverything in my store would be under 20 dollars. There would be nothing in there over 20 dollars.,INTERVIEWER, Clothes too?,INTERVIEWEE, Everything under 20 dollars.,INTERVIEWER, Snooper-markets?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, Well have you talked to people about it?,INTERVIEWEE, I'm talking to them right now.,INTERVIEWER, Not bad.,INTERVIEWEE, I mean you hear them talking back?,INTERVIEWER, What did you make about Michael Jackson passing?,INTERVIEWEE, I was ,INTERVIEWER, Did you know Michael?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes I knew Michael Jackson. I'm a close friend of the family. I love Michael Jackson and what he done for music what he done for life and I'm justyou know I'm just a fan you know? So I love everything that he done. He could never do no wrong in my eyes. I mean I love the music that he made the spirit that he brought just showing people how to love and how to reach out and then give back because that's what he did with most of his time and his money. It was spent on giving back. He was never about himself. He was always about others.,INTERVIEWER, How did Dr. Dre find you?,INTERVIEWEE, His brother half-brother Warren G. Was in my group 213me him and Nate Dogg. And we had a cassette tape and Warren G took it to Dr. Dre's bachelor party. And the music had cut off from the bachelor party. So he slipped my tape in and when my tape came in people was dancing to it. And Dre was like who was that? He was like that's my homeboy Snoop. He introduced me to him and the rest is history.,INTERVIEWER, Back with our remaining moments with Snoop Dogg. And we are joined by his son Corde. Is this the oldest boy?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, It's a great pleasure to welcome to Larry King Live as always a good friend old friend the vice president of the United States Joe Biden. Thanks for coming in.,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah it's great to be back with you Larry.,INTERVIEWER, It's always good. This is like the hundredth time.,INTERVIEWEE, Well I'll tell you what ,INTERVIEWER, Senator ,INTERVIEWEE,I don't know. It's a long time. But I'll tell you what. I told you this before my mother who lived with me passed away last January. I never once walked in her house late in the evening that you weren't on the air. And so II miss her and I'm really going to miss you man. The country is going to miss you doing this.,INTERVIEWER, All right let's get into things. Early today ObamaPresident Obamamade you the focus on getting this treaty signed.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, What's holdingyou know no DemocratI'm told today no Democratic president ever had a nuclear treaty.,INTERVIEWEE, Well that's true. And that's why this idea that somehow that some Republicans arepundits are talking about you can't let Obama have a win. This is not an Obama win. This is a continuation of aof a bipartisan policy. It started with Ronald Reagan in this case. It's critically important to our national security interests. And I think we're going to get it passed. I still think we're going to get it passed. And what the president ,INTERVIEWER, You have to get Republicans to come over don't you?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes we have to get eight Republicans to vote with us beyond Dick Lugar. Dick Lugar is as you know the single most informed guy probably in either political party on the issue of nuclear weapons and arms control. And he is passionate about it. I met today Larry withwe have five former Republican secretaries of state who think this is essential. Former Republican secretaries of defense national security advisers. And so ,INTERVIEWER, So why are they fighting you?,INTERVIEWEE, Well wewe actually haven't laid the treaty down yet. We've been working very closely with a very bright guy John Kyl a Republican who's their point man on the details of the treaty.,INTERVIEWER, But hedidn't he announce he was against it?,INTERVIEWEE, Well no but he announced that he didn't think there was enough time to consider it in a lame duck session. But the president has made clear today to the congressional leadership and he made clear to theto the outside experts these Republican secretaries of State and Defense et cetera that this is his highest priority.,INTERVIEWER, But if you're the point man that means what?,INTERVIEWEE, Well that means ,INTERVIEWER, You have to round up the eight guys?,INTERVIEWEE, Well noyes I do. But beyond that Larry you know I've spent the bulk of my adult life dealing with strategic doctrine that is things relating to nuclear weapons. From the time I was a young man at age 30 it's something Iat least I'm informed a great deal about. People notmay not think I'm right but I think the vast majority of the informed community in terms of national strategic doctrine knows that this is something that inas my brother would say in my wheelhouse. And soand I still have great relationships in the United States Senate. So the president asked me to coordinate the efforts of the State Department of the Defense Department the intelligence community and making the best case possible to the United States Senate something I spent a lot of years trying to do.,INTERVIEWER, So you're going to get it?,INTERVIEWEE, I think we're going to get it.,INTERVIEWER, OK. Let's go to other things. Waswas the term shellacking correct as to what happened to you ,INTERVIEWEE, Well yes look ,INTERVIEWER,and the guys?,INTERVIEWEE, Look ,INTERVIEWER, And the ladies?,INTERVIEWEE, Look we lost thethe House as big as we had won itbigger than we had won it. And we hung on to the Senate. But Ias I was saying briefly coming in if you take a look at where the unemployment rates were the highest across the country and the districts you just tack on a R as opposed to a D in most of those districts. It's awful hard to win elections when there's 9.5 unemployment 9.6 9.7 percent unemployment. And so it was a real loss. But whatthere was a real message sent. The message was they didn't have a lot of faith in Republican Party and they don't have a lot of faith in the Democratic Party. And so they're saying OK we want you guys to work together.,INTERVIEWER, But shouldn't frankly you have focused on jobs before the health bill?,INTERVIEWEE, Well look ,INTERVIEWER, In retrospect.,INTERVIEWEE, In retrospect that can be argued and some argued that beforehand. The idea that we weren't focusing on jobs while we were focusing on health care is not accurate but when you turn on the television every day for a year and it's just health care all the work we're doing on creating jobs and dealing with trade and all those issues they justit's not anybodyI'm not complaining I'm just stating the fact that it just has not surfaced. And that's why you're going to see for the next two years all we're about is American competitiveness Americanmade in America and American jobs. And we need to cooperate Democrats and Republicans.,INTERVIEWER, Should frankly the president have been doing a better job in the area of what iswhat weyou know what's reality and what's perception?,INTERVIEWEE, Well look ,INTERVIEWER, Did he do a poor job in perception?,INTERVIEWEE, Look I don't think hehe didn't misunderstand at all the dilemma we faced. But he knew for example thatagain this isit's our responsibility. So this is notit's not the other guy.,INTERVIEWER, The buck stops.,INTERVIEWEE, The buck stops with us. It actually stops with the president he's the guy that makes the final decision God love him. But here's the deal. We found ourselves in the position where the banks were collapsing so we have to make sure that the financial markets were stabilizedone of the most unpopular things you could possibly do. It'd bewould have been easier to pass through the Senate and the House a resolution saying protect rattlesnakes you know? I mean they didn't want toyou know I understand that. And then we believed we had to deal with long-term debt and the biggestthe biggest driver of long-term debt is health care costs. And that's the unspoken part about the health care bill we passed. It's about the gigantic savings long term in terms of federal spending on health care. But again we ,INTERVIEWER, But does it ,INTERVIEWEE, We could have done a lot of things better in retrospect.,INTERVIEWER, Including perception right?,INTERVIEWEE, Including perception. But we've learned from where we are and we're determined to take advantage of those lessons and notyou know have the perception clearly focused.,INTERVIEWER, What's behind the postponement of the "Slurpee Summit"?,INTERVIEWEE, Oh well look there's a whole lot there. Look the truth of the matter is I met with Mitch McConnell I've talked with John Boehner when I called to congratulate him. These guys want to meet and ,INTERVIEWER, So?,INTERVIEWEE, And so it's wenow the 30th. It was never nailed down finally for lastthis Thursday and I think it's a much ado being made about not much at all. We're going to be meeting on the 30th the president and I and the leadership.,INTERVIEWER, Who else? All the leaders?,INTERVIEWEE, No. Well the Republican leadership it's going to be the House and Senate Republican leadership. I assume that will include the number two and number three in the House and the Senate. But mainly it's John Boehner and it is Mitch McConnell. And look I know both these guys. I work with them. I get along well with them. I think there ought to be places where we can agree. And the most important thing we can agree on is how to grow the economy.,INTERVIEWER, And we'll be right back with the vice president of the United States. His wife's going to join us later will particularly improve this set. Don't go away.,INTERVIEWEE, That's cute.,INTERVIEWER, We're back with the vice president of the United States. Nancy Pelosi is coming back this time as minority leader. She was a lightning rod you've got to admit that.,INTERVIEWEE, Oh yes. When you spend 65000$65 million to make someone a lightning rod it works. I go back far enough. You and I remember when Tip O'Neill was made the lightning rod. Remember that off-year race with Reagan?,INTERVIEWER, Sure do.,INTERVIEWEE, But look she also is the most effective person in generating results in the House. The House members decided she was the one that she ,INTERVIEWER, But people either like her or don't like her.,INTERVIEWEE, Well you know ,INTERVIEWER, She's not a halfway.,INTERVIEWEE, I think that's the case with almost all great leaders. People either are going to like Ronald Reagan or didn't like him. They liked George Bush or didn't. They liked Bill Clinton or didn't.,INTERVIEWER, Do you think Pelosi is a great leader?,INTERVIEWEE, Well I think she is. I think she's a very very effective and competent person. She gets things done. And it's easy toyou know in this environment toyou know to characterize someone. Again if you notice the thing I love about her never complain and never explain my dad's notion. This is one tough smart lady. Let's get to business let's move on now let's see what we can get done.,INTERVIEWER, All right. Now are you going to extend the Bush tax cuts ,INTERVIEWEE, Well look I tell you ,INTERVIEWER,for all the rich folk?,INTERVIEWEE, Nono. Let me tell you what our position is. Our position is we want to permanently extend the tax cuts for middle class people for the top 98 percent of the wage earners in Americaor the 98 percent of the wage earners in America. We don't think we can afford to extend permanently the tax cuts for the top two percent. That would blow another $700 billion hole in the budget. And so our position is permanent for the middle class and not permanent for the top.,INTERVIEWER, But temporarily?,INTERVIEWEE, We're going to be sitting downwe're going to be sitting down on the 30th with the Republicansthe Republican leadership say guys here's our position what's yours and let's see if we can work something out. We're not looking for confrontation. We know if we don't extend the tax cuts for the middle class not only is it notis it unfair but it will have just an incredible drag on the economy.,INTERVIEWER, But you don't want to lose your left do you?,INTERVIEWEE, No we don't want to lose our left. But look what we want to do basically is what's right right for the country. And what's right for the country is both in terms of fairness and economic growth is giving the middle class who's been batteredfrom 2001 to 2008 they lost five percent of their worth five percent of their income. And you know I don't want to take away from them now. Look a family of four making 50000 bucks Larry a man and a woman they get a $2100 tax break now. Ifput it another way if you don't extend it their taxes go up $2100. $2100 for a family of four means the difference between if they can pay their automobile insurance to drive their automobiles to work if they have a job. A family of four making 100000 grand that's $4100. That's a difference where they can keep two kids in school and particularly if one's a private institution. So this matters to people who make less than $250000.,INTERVIEWER, Let's touchwe're going to touch some bases here.,INTERVIEWEE, Sure absolutely.,INTERVIEWER, I mean you're here right?,INTERVIEWEE, I got you. Fire away.,INTERVIEWER, I'm leaving soon.,INTERVIEWEE, I'm going with you.,INTERVIEWER, We both go out on a sinking ship.,INTERVIEWEE, That's right.,INTERVIEWER, All right. What do you make of the Charlie Rangel matter?,INTERVIEWEE, Well you know I ,INTERVIEWER, Is he a friend?,INTERVIEWEE, He is a friend. I give you my word I don't know the detail the charges but when the Ethics Committee runa bipartisan committee rules that he violated X number of rules of the House then you know it's hard to argue against. I think the rules apply and they apply but I don't know the details. I really don't.,INTERVIEWER, They don't put him out though do they?,INTERVIEWEE, I hope not. I don't think so. But I don't know enoughI give you my word I don't know enough about the specifics of each of the rulings.,INTERVIEWER, OK. All right. TheSarah Palin has apparently now confirmed that she's thinking about running for president. How does that make Joe Biden think?,INTERVIEWEE, Well youIlook I think Sarah Palin has turned out to be and she is a real force in the Republican Party. And I think Sarah Palin isIwere I a Republican senator or a Republican political leader I would look and say wait she's got a good chance of getting the nomination. But look it's hard enough for us to figure our side of the aisle let alone go over and sort of handicap whether she can win or lose.,INTERVIEWER, What do you think of her?,INTERVIEWEE, Well I like her.,INTERVIEWER, You do?,INTERVIEWEE, I meanno no I personally like her. I mean if you met her she's an appealing person. When we campaigned ,INTERVIEWER, You debated her.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes we debated. There was not a harsh word. I mean we have a fundamentally different outlook on the world and I think that would be a really a really interesting race.,INTERVIEWER, Would that be a race you'd like to take on?,INTERVIEWEE, Well you know my mom used to have an expression be careful what you wish for Joe you may get it. So I never underestimate anyone. Andbut I think in that race it would be a clear clear choice for the country to make and I believe President Obama would be in very good shape.,INTERVIEWER, The White House shot down the rumors that you and Hillary Clinton were going to do a switch.,INTERVIEWEE, I tried but it didn't work. No. I ,INTERVIEWER, Because you wanted State didn't you?,INTERVIEWEE, No no no.,INTERVIEWER, No? OK. All right.,INTERVIEWEE, No no. Look here's the dealthe president and I there was never any serious talk ever that anyone ever heard about me not being on the ticket with him or her not staying at State.,INTERVIEWER, Woodward started it though.,INTERVIEWEE, Well if you look ateven Bob backed off a little bit on that as hewhat he said is I readand I read his book. What he basically said was when she was being considered for secretary of State it was suggested by one of her pollsters she should take it because maybe there would be the opportunity to be vice president. Hillary has made it clear right from the first time I came out Joe I don't want to be vice president. The president has made it clear Joe I expect you to be on the ticket. I want you on the ticket. So it was really kind ofyou know sort of a Washington parlor game. INTERVIEWER, Moremore with the vice president of the United States right after this. We're back with Joe Biden the vice president. The former Guantanamo detainee is tried on ain a civilian court. He's acquitted on all but one of 280 charges. The other side says he should have been found guilty on all of them. One side said though if it's a result of terror you can't introduce it in court. Where do you stand?,INTERVIEWEE, Well if it's a result of torture ,INTERVIEWER, Torture I'm sorry.,INTERVIEWEE, Look the fact of the matter is what's going to happen to him he's going to go to jail for a minimum of 20 years to life. Had he been tried in a tribunal which some of the critics say he should have been tried in a military tribunal the same evidenceand they voted for the change in the rule of the tribunal the same evidence would have been inadmissible. If we held them as some have suggested on the right just held them indefinitely as aas abasically a detainee a prisoner of war the idea that Guantanamo is going to be around in 50 years and him still in jail withI think our bets are better. This proves what exactly what George Bush did. When you go to so-called Article 3 courts that is try in federal courts all this stuff was you can't try them in federal courts you've got to worry about terrorists attacking the court. You can't try him in federal courts they're not going to get sentenced. He's getting a longer sentence. He'll be in jail longer than if any other method were tried. Same thing George Bush did with the shoe bomber. Same thing he did with the 24th hijacker.,INTERVIEWER, So you're saying in the future with others you would go civilian court?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes. There's no reason not to go with civilian court based on this case at least.,INTERVIEWER, OK. In week one of the administration your president signed an executive order requiring the Gitmo detention facility closed within a year.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, Still there.,INTERVIEWEE, Still there.,INTERVIEWER, Why?,INTERVIEWEE, Because what we found out when we got in there is there's an awful lot of very tough cases that present real real difficult situations. And so we stillour intention is still to close it. But ,INTERVIEWER, But?,INTERVIEWEE, But we could not meet that within a year.,INTERVIEWER, Spoke to soon?,INTERVIEWEE, Wellthe answerI speak for myself. I spoke too soon because quite frankly we didn't have all the detailed data on every single prisoner the status of that prisoner what that prisoner's circumstance was whether we could move them into an Article 3 court whether they should be released et cetera or whether they should be tried in a military court. That's the process. It's being whittled down until we get down to the point where we're able to deal with having to either transfer move try or release. AndI knoweveryone that's in thatin that prison system.,INTERVIEWER, Well are you saying it's going to be around a while?,INTERVIEWEE, Well I don't know how much longer it's going to be around but Iwhat I am saying the rest of the world understands we're making a good faith effort to deal with it and it has helped us a great deal in our overall war against terror. If you notice they're no longer using the argument that was being used three years ago that you know Americans don't mean what they say about civil liberties Americans don't meanwe're getting overwhelming cooperation now from not only ourand I'm deeply involved in this piecenot only from our European friends but we're also getting overwhelming cooperation from Muslim states. And you know states where there iswhere al Qaeda is trying to burrow in and reside.,INTERVIEWER, Wouldn't it have been politically smart franklyyou're an old they don't come on the older hands than Joe Biden. Politically smart for you to announce tonight that in the future these kind of trials like Khalid Sheikh Mohammed that's going to go to a military court? That that would be a plus politically?,INTERVIEWEE, Well itIit would be a plus politically for people who didn't focus on it. But the example I just gave you the trial we just had. We are going to put this guy in jail longer than he ever would be had he gone to a military court. And what we want to show to the world is we're not afraid of putting our criminal justice system for the whole world to see. There is no reason that we are a nation of laws and we can accomplish our end of taking these very bad guys off the street for a long long long time if not forever.,INTERVIEWER, Joe Biden is our guest. He's been the point man on Iraq. What is your assessment of how that country is doing?,INTERVIEWEE, It's doingit's doing very very well. Here's the deal. It took them a long time to form a government because it was a close election. They have now formed a government that reflectsonly demand I made and I've been on the phone Ior I've been there six times since we've been elected. I know every one of these Iraqi leaders by their first names I know their children. I mean I know them. We've been deeply involved. We've a great ambassador and general over there in General Austin. And we've been deeply deeply involved in helping them facilitate thea government that reflects the outcome of the election. You know they always say Larry that in a new democracy the most important election's the second one. A lot of them have a first one but they don't have a second one. And what's happened now is that we'rethere's a real power sharing arrangement underneathwithin the context of their constitution. We have kept our commitment. We said we'd end this war responsibly. We got all the troops out of the cities last summer. We brought home 100000 troops that we promised this summer. And we're going to be out of there by the end of 2011 and we're going to leave behind a stable government because the Iraqis stepped up to the ball. Politics broke out in Iraq.,INTERVIEWER, We're with Vice President Joe Biden. This is hisget this49th appearance on Larry King Live.,INTERVIEWEE, It's been an honor.,INTERVIEWER, And we've been on the air 25 1/2 years that's two a year. OK. With those specialsmaybe we'll do a special on the Joe Biden I know.,INTERVIEWEE, I want to be honest with you.,INTERVIEWER, OK Afghanistan. A lot of Americans say leave.,INTERVIEWEE, Well I don't blame them for wanting to say that. Look here are the facts in Afghanistan. We inherited a war that had been neglected for eight years. Neglected. The first thing the president asked me to do after we got elected before we got sworn in he said Joe I want you to go to Afghanistan give me an independent assessment of what you think we should do come back and report. I used to be Chairman of Foreign Relations. I came back and I said Mr. President you ask 10 of our combatant commanders you ask 10 of our civilians why they think we're there you get 10 different answers. There is no clear rationale why we're there. So we sat down and I recommended and he then added to it the notion that wewhy are we there? We're there to make sure al Qaeda isis degraded and ultimately defeated. What we calleverybody now calls al Qaeda central in those mountains in Pakistan and Afghanistan that they cannot return and use Afghanistan as a platform. Number two we give the freely elected government an opportunity to be able to protect itself against itsagainst the Taliban and any other interests that it can't reconcile with. And we're going to train up their forces. And here's what we said. We said we're going to add additional resources to get that done. We're going to begin to transition our military out of IraqI mean excuse me Afghanistan in the summerthis coming summer. And now all of NATOthe president is about to head off to meet with NATO all ,INTERVIEWER, And Americans might say but how many die before 2014?,INTERVIEWEE, Well unfortunately if one dies it's one too many. I had a son who spent a year in Iraq. And every single day I got up and every single day having been to Iraq 17 or 18 times it was on my mind. And I wouldI'd walk in Larry and I swear to God ininto the kitchen while Jill was getting coffee and making toast and she'd be mouthing a prayer. Every minute if you have a husband wife son daughter there every minute it's on your mind. But here's the deal this is what we inherited and we had to finish it. We're making significant progress against al Qaeda. It has been significantly diminished in that so-called al Qaeda Central. And at the same time we are moving into a new position where we're not going to need American forces in those 34 provinces protecting the Afghani people. They're going to begin to do that themselves. And our NATO allies believe we can begin to transition some of those 34 provinces beginning in January.,INTERVIEWER, Do you have faith in President Karzai?,INTERVIEWEE, Look I knowI've known President Karzai for a long long time. I think he's in a very difficult position. I haveyou know we could argue that there could be a stronger leader but you deal with the hand you're dealt as the old saying goes. And we are all on the same page now for the first timethe American military the American civilians the administration the Congress the NATO our allies the Afghanis that here's the deal you've got to step up your governance capability. We're going to help train your folks. You've got to step upwe cannot want peace and security more than you want it in your villages and in your homes. We're going to help train you. In the meantime we've said aand you know a lot ofa lot of our critics say you shouldn't set a deadline to get out. The reason we needed to do that is the same reason we did in it in Afghanistan. We had to say look you've got to step up man. Let me tell you we're going to startdaddy is going to start to take the training wheels off in OctoberI mean in next July so you'd better practice riding.,INTERVIEWER, The wife will be joining us shortly. But one other thing I want to cover before she does join us and that's Don't Ask Don't Tell.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, You were against it as I understand?,INTERVIEWEE, I am.,INTERVIEWER, Certainly the president is against it.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, Most of the administration is against it. Apparently they polled troops they're against it. And you poll America and they're against it. So why is this our policy?,INTERVIEWEE, It is notit islook Larry this is complicated for people to understand and I don't blame them.,INTERVIEWER, Simplify it.,INTERVIEWEE, Simplified as easy as I can say it is Congress passed a policy it has not repealed yet.,INTERVIEWER, But the president could sign it away couldn't he?,INTERVIEWEE, No the president couldn'tcannot sign it away. What the president can theoretically do is tell the Justice Department to breach what is the understanding that all Justice Departments have. Justice Departments are obliged to defend laws constitutionally passed by the U.S. Congress and signed by former presidents.,INTERVIEWER, So they attorney general ,INTERVIEWEE, So ,INTERVIEWER,has to defend it for now?,INTERVIEWEE, He has to defend it for now. We are pushing it as hard as we can. We just had a meeting today with the leadership in the Congress saying we very much would like to see you pass legislation now saying end Don't Ask Don't Tell.,INTERVIEWER, Dick Cheneynot Dick Cheney I'm sorry. Colin Powell was here the other night.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, And,INTERVIEWEE, A good guy.,INTERVIEWER,said that he supports John McCain in this matter. Let's wait until we do the whole investigation by the military. Let's wait until we hear from everybody don't rush it.,INTERVIEWEE, Well ,INTERVIEWER, Do you agree with that?,INTERVIEWEE, We're going to see that very very shortly. There's going to be a report early in December coming from the Defense Department andon their recommendation. So as my grand papa used to say with the grace of God and the goodwill of the neighbors they'll be a confluence of the two.,INTERVIEWER, Do you think we'll see the end of it by the end of the year?,INTERVIEWEE, I hope so. I hope so.,INTERVIEWER, We're back. He's been on 49 times over the years. This is her first appearance. Dr. Jill Biden who taught three classes today at her school. She is of course Mrs.what are you Mrs. First Lady? What do they call you Second Lady?,INTERVIEWEE, Second Lady second lady.,INTERVIEWER, Second lady.,INTERVIEWEE, Or captain of the vice team.,INTERVIEWER, Has he changed?,INTERVIEWEE, Oh no he hasn't changed.,INTERVIEWER, I mean now he's vice president. Has he changed?,INTERVIEWEE, No I don't think. Not at all.,INTERVIEWER, You say that you love her more than she loves you.,INTERVIEWEE, Everybody knows that.,INTERVIEWER, You think so?,INTERVIEWEE, Probably. Oh God.,INTERVIEWER, You stillyou taught three classes.,INTERVIEWEE, I did yes.,INTERVIEWER, You teach?,INTERVIEWEE, I teach writing. I teach English at Northern Virginia Community College.,INTERVIEWER, Why do you continue to work? INTERVIEWEE, Well it's what I do. You know I've been an English teacher for 30 years and it's what I love. And when we were elected I said to Joe I'm going to continue to teach. And he saidAnd I strongly encouraged her. Yes. Look I think it's really important that someone in Jill's position as second lady or the wife of an elected official if they want to has their own separate sphere and their ownand she's deeply involved in matters relating to the White House. And besides she loves it. I don't knowAnd he's always been supportive of my career and whatever I do.,INTERVIEWER, Were you teaching when you met?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes. Yes I was. I was teaching.,INTERVIEWER, Always at the junior college ,INTERVIEWEE, No I taught high school for 13 years actually.,INTERVIEWER, Why do you like teaching so much?,INTERVIEWEE, Well I think especially at the community college I think I do make a difference in their lives. You know they're working they're going to school they're raising families.,INTERVIEWER, Are they 18 19 20?,INTERVIEWEE, Orno they're all ages. So actually I think 26 is like the average age of a community college student. And I think I make a difference. I can make a difference.,INTERVIEWER, I see you a lot with Michelle Obama.,INTERVIEWEE, Right yes.,INTERVIEWER, PSAs public service announcements. How do you two really get along?,INTERVIEWEE, We really like one another. And I think from the very beginning when we got together I think you know fate brought us together. And she had her projects that she was interested in and I had mine but the one thing that we came together was military families. And so that's what we're working on together and we have a lot of fun together.,INTERVIEWER, We just heard your husband talk about Iraq and Afghanistan. Now you talk to military families right? ,INTERVIEWEE, I do.,INTERVIEWER, Wives husbands children.,INTERVIEWEE, Children yes.,INTERVIEWER, We know we always hear about the military families who say we support them. Do you hear from people who say we don't support them?,INTERVIEWEE, Never.,INTERVIEWER, They don't say ,INTERVIEWEE, Not from Americans no. I think ,INTERVIEWER, They don't say we wish you'd bring them back?,INTERVIEWEE, Of course we wish would bring them back but We always hear can you get my son home quicker or my daughter home quicker. Right. Yes.,INTERVIEWER, Your son was there. Your stepson.,INTERVIEWEE, Well we don't say "step" Larry.,INTERVIEWER, What do you say?,INTERVIEWEE, We don't. He's just our son. Son yes.,INTERVIEWER, We're back with the Bidens. What a couple they are. And you had to go through the loss of a wife.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes. But I tell you no man deserves one great love let alone two. I got real lucky.,INTERVIEWER, Is this your first marriage?,INTERVIEWEE, No this is my second.,INTERVIEWER, So you've had two loves.,INTERVIEWEE, Well yes. Maybe maybe.,INTERVIEWER, That's a great line.,INTERVIEWEE, I love you child. I love you.,INTERVIEWER, Back to the militarythat was funny. The outgoing chairman of the House Armed Services Committee Ike Skelton says he worries that there's a kind of chasma chasm between American civilians and the military families and their thoughts. In other words a lot of civilians say we should get out of there. The military families let's stay in there. That seems like a contradiction in terms. You would think the military family would be more interested in them coming home.,INTERVIEWEE, I also think he said if you don't mind my sayingI know Ike really well. He and I have talked at length about here you have one percent of the population fighting these wars ,INTERVIEWER, Right.,INTERVIEWEE,and does the other 99 percent understand what they're going through? And that was one of the chasms that Ike spoke about. And Jill has worked withI mean anywayyou were asked the question. I apologize. But I think that they are so proud of what they're doing. I mean that's their job. That's what they're committed to do and they have pride in their work and what they're doing.,INTERVIEWER, Do they understand it?,INTERVIEWEE, I think they do understand it. And how could they not understand it with all the news coverage?,INTERVIEWER, You came in an administration headed by a man very opposed to war. Well who isn't opposed to war?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, But voted against Iraq.,INTERVIEWEE, Well look ,INTERVIEWER, Has that perception in himand maybe both of youchanged sincein the past two years?,INTERVIEWEE, Look he was against the war in Iraq because he thought it could have been avoided and it should have been avoided. He at the very beginning was not againsthe thought we had to react in Afghanistan where al Qaeda was where theywhere they came in andand actually killed us. And the thing that's interesting about the confluence of his commitment to make America safe and what Jill does running around the country isyou notice there's this great phrase only one percent of the Americans are fighting the war but 99 percent owe them their support. And it'sit's really interesting. Both Jill and Barack are from the Vietnamnot the Vietnam era. They did nottheirtheir ,INTERVIEWER, But you are.,INTERVIEWEE, I am. I am. Andand so what Jill and Barack wanted to make sure and Michelle wasand I agree with themthatthat coming home from these wars that they never are treated like the guys in my generation who came home. Instead of being spat upon they'd be embraced. And so that's why I thinkin fact I knowwhy Jill and Michelle spent so much time going around the country reminding people.,INTERVIEWER, You meet with people who've lost people?,INTERVIEWEE, Oh yes. All the time.,INTERVIEWER, How do you deal with that?,INTERVIEWEE, Well itit is really hard and Joe and I have spent a lot of timea lot of time with wounded warriors. Actually next Monday we're having a dinner for wounded warriors at the residence. We did it lastWe have three Thanksgivings a year. Yeah. We did it last Thanksgiving. We've been to many many hospitals burn centers. It's tough. It's really tough.,INTERVIEWER, There's no formula is there?,INTERVIEWEE, No. There's no formula. Andbut the one thing thatone of the reasons I wanted Joe to join this team to join this administration is that Barack wanted to getwanted to get out of Iraq. And I so badly wanted to get out of Iraq especially since I had a son going to Iraq. Well I wanted to get out of Iraq but it's interesting I did not initially want to be vice president. And when asked initially I saidhe said he needed an answer right away and II said well if you need an answer now Barack the answer's no. And he said well go home and talk to your family about it and get back to me. And it really surprised me when I went home Jill said you've got to do this. And this is not a woman who's pushing me to run for President before or wanted me to be vice president. But it was her firm conviction about Iraq.,INTERVIEWER, We're back with the Bidens. Did Iraq change your son?,INTERVIEWEE, I don't think so. Do you Joe? I don't think it changed him. I think ithe came away with an overwhelming impression about the men and women he served with. Notnonono joke. I mean he said dad you'd be amazed at these guys and these women. You'd just be amazed. And II was not amazed. I was there so many times. But Jill came with me and an interesting thing. On the way back I said you know Jill I feel guilty. I was here four times during the year Bo was here in Iraq. And I always felt guilty I got to see him. And I said I wish you had. And tell him your reaction to that. Yeah. I said if I had beenif I had gone when Bo was there I couldn't have left him there. You know I don't think any mother who goes to a war zone could ever leave a child in a war zone.,INTERVIEWER, Couple of other things. You said that America's community colleges are its best kept secret.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, In what way?,INTERVIEWEE, Well I think community collegecolleges offer so much and especially inin this economy. You know they'repeople come to them for job training. They're a fraction of the cost of four-year colleges. And ,INTERVIEWER, You never hear about them much.,INTERVIEWEE, Well I hope that's changed.,INTERVIEWER, You're changing it.,INTERVIEWEE, I hope that's changed because this administration so supports community colleges and education. And that's one of the joys of working in this administration. And soShe even spoke in the international forum in the U.N. about you know have everybody trying to set up Harvards of the world in these developing countries. And the point is what you've got to do is you set up these community colleges quickly. You get the biggest bang for the buck they're more affordable people get something substantial for careers out of them and it'sit's a good buy.,INTERVIEWER, OK. Thanksgiving's right around the corner. What do you make in a lot of discussion now in America youeverybody's got an opinion the pat-down policy? Cause there's going to millions at airports.,INTERVIEWEE, Well look Larry maybe because I spend so much time every morning dealing with the threat assessment that's out there and the fact that it's realI understand peoples' frustration but Iunless there's a new technology that comes along pretty quickly I think it'sI think it's a necessary policy. I think it will have the effect of saving lives intercepting explosives oror before ,INTERVIEWER, But in a democracy it's an invasion. I mean it is an invasion.,INTERVIEWEE, WellIt is but if you think about it I mean really we're fightingI mean terrorism isit's a threat. And I think Americans shouldI mean they should realize it andand put up with it I think.,INTERVIEWER, Anyone in the administration against doing it?,INTERVIEWEE, No. We're all in the administration saying continue to look to see what the best technology and the least intrusive that gives us the greatest security.,INTERVIEWER, How you guys spending Thanksgiving?,INTERVIEWEE, We go to Nantucket and we've done it for over 30 years to get away. It's been 35 years. Back after we first gotfive years after the accident I met Jill. I had an administrative assistant wonderful guy who was 20 years older. And her mom and dad wanted me and the boys to come to dinner my mom and dad and my deceased wife's mom and dad. And he said the way to do that ishe said pick a spot where just you and the family go every year so no one's offended. And heI said where. And he saidI said Nantucket. I've never been to Nantucket in the winter. I mean whatand we've been doing it for 35 years. Now 20 of us go. Our children.,INTERVIEWER, We're out of time. Thanks Jill. Your first appearance.,INTERVIEWEE, Oh thanks. And happy birthday.,INTERVIEWER, Thank you. Yes tomorrow. Thank you. Hey thanks for the kind words.,INTERVIEWEE, A great run old buddy.,INTERVIEWER, Good evening. Stevie Wonder needs no introduction. So why am I introducing him? Except for this. He is a genius one of the most influential artists and people of our time. We welcome him back to Larry King Live. He is the recipient of 25 Grammys and a Lifetime Grammy. He's a political and social activist. Last time he was on this show by the way he was on the eve of the inauguration of Barack Obama. We start that way Stevie. How do you think he's doing?,INTERVIEWEE, I think President Obama is doing very well. I think then obviously we were with a mess unfortunately the previousat the end of the previous eight years. And I think you know it's almost like when you gain a lot of weight it takes more than a minute to get it off. So we've got some things that we got into unfortunately that happened. It's going to take it time to get it back to where it needs to be and to move forward. But I think that he is moving the world forward. I think that you know reports are coming out that basically that the economy is getting better that jobs that are happening and I just think that we have top stay on point as a united people of America.,INTERVIEWER, Stevie Wonder you've always been an activist by the way? Are you always active in political things?,INTERVIEWEE, I was sort of like the year we were talking aboutlike when I was a little kid obviously activist trying to make sure my mother got me what I wanted to get for Christmas. So ,INTERVIEWER, Active in that.,INTERVIEWEE, But no I think I've always had myyou know my feelings about different things and obviously you know the whole thing about what's right and what's wrong. I think that maybe more a socialist you know just feeling that there is no reason why we can't you know work it out as a united people of the United States of America but not just that of the world.,INTERVIEWER, All right. Let's discuss this extraordinary career. Where did you grow up?,INTERVIEWEE, Detroit.,INTERVIEWER, A child of Detroit born blind?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes. Well actually I was not born blind but shortly after that because of being premature I had then being in the incubator (INAUDIBLE)it is a condition ,INTERVIEWER, Do you see some light?,INTERVIEWEE, I may have. I think the retrolental fibroplasia that's what it's called. And it happens fromor it happened anyway from the temperature of thehaving to much oxygen and many kids that were born in the '50s before the doctor discovered that you know there was another way to do it I became blind.,INTERVIEWER, Do you have brothers and sisters?,INTERVIEWEE, I havenow five or four brother and one sister. I lost a brother a few years ago.,INTERVIEWER, They were all sighted?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, How did your parentswhat did your father do?,INTERVIEWEE, My father really was not the dominant person who raised the family it was my mother who raised the family. And my mother worked at a fish company working withfor a while and then fortunately we were blessed with me being discovered at the age of 9 then signing to Motown by the age of 10 and then at 11 had the first record out.,INTERVIEWER, And that helped the whole family?,INTERVIEWEE, We did make some money.,INTERVIEWER, You were a protegee. When did youdid you play piano like when you were like 5?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes I played piano. I mean Iyou know obviously sound was very important to me. So when I was able toyou know to touch that thing what's called a piano you know I was curious about it and I think the firstthat was probably the first thing that I played.,INTERVIEWER, "Three Blind Mice.",INTERVIEWEE, Exactly.,INTERVIEWER, Appropriately enough. Was itit had to be tough. I've interviewed George Schering. I'm sure you knew George Schering.,INTERVIEWEE, He was great. Great man.,INTERVIEWER, Yes. He said that when you've never seen he didn't regard it as a handicap. Because that's the only thing he knew.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes. I mean it's definitely more difficult for someone who has seen and then lost their sight because obviously you're used to seeing and you used to being able to look at something then rather than go right to it even though that's you know true it's not impossible to survive and to live. So ,INTERVIEWER, Obviously you've proven it. We're going to trace some extraordinary musical career. We've just started with Stevie Wonder. We'll talk more about his inner visions too. Don't go away.,INTERVIEWEE, Now let me say this to you. I want to interview you too.,INTERVIEWER, OK. In a while.,INTERVIEWEE, I'm a fan of yours. I know you're going to be ,INTERVIEWER, We're back with Stevie Wonder. Do you remember the first thing you ever wrote? INTERVIEWEE, There's a song I wrote called "Elephant Della.",INTERVIEWEE, Elephant Della that's the name I keep hearing in my heart. Elephant Dellait's like some ,INTERVIEWER, That could be a hit.,INTERVIEWEE, I don't think so. It wasn't then and it's not now.,INTERVIEWER, What was the first hit?,INTERVIEWEE, The first hit we had was a song called "Fingertips." And originally ,INTERVIEWER, Third album right?,INTERVIEWEE, That was in theyes third album. The jazz soul of my heart. The first time it was recorded it was a live (INAUDIBLE) which was a project that Motown did with me playing the harmonica and the piano and drums and stuff. So it's like a kind of jazzed project. And than we did "Tribute to Uncle Ray" which is a tribute to Ray Charles that we did. And then we were on the Motown Menu and in Chicago the "Fingertips" was done again. We came up with a live version of it. Clarence Paul who was my music director at the time came up with an idea foryou know everybody say yes and all that stuff. And that was put on the album that was called "Little Stevie Wonder Live at the Apollo.",INTERVIEWER, You're alwaysyou ain't so little anymore. You were once Little Stevie Wonder right?,INTERVIEWEE, Never little. Big in spirit. Small in size. Growth to kind of match my spirit.,INTERVIEWER, Did the harmonica come naturally to you too?,INTERVIEWEE, It was aharmonica was something that you know obviously growing up in Detroit you'd hear the different harmonica players come and playing the blues and walking down on the streets. When I was off for the Christmas holiday season an uncle gave me a harmonicachromatic harmonica. And obviously I didn't know what to do with the button. I said what is this for? Andso likebut then I figured that you know for me playing the harmonica after a while was like the saxophone to me. And so it was like ,INTERVIEWER, You take to music you're called a genius. Did that bother you being called a genius so young? INTERVIEWEE, The amazing thing about being called a genius is I never paid any attention to it. I mean I appreciated it but II think since the very early age I felt like this here is a gift from God and I'm only being used as a vehicle through which I can do these things. So you know when you think about it at 13 years old you know you're a big star and all of that kind of stuff. And you're talking about these interviews and things they're going to do. OK fine but I want to go and watch "Huckleberry Hound." I was definitely a kid. And you never stop being a kid. When you write a song where does it come from? I mean you don't see colors. You don't see people. You don't know what a television set looks like. You feel a piano but you've never seen a piano. Where does the music come from?,INTERVIEWEE, I honestly think that if Iyou know were to see a piano or to see someone or all the other things you mentioned Iif ever I was to see it I think I'd be pretty close to where I imagine it to be. I think I've got a pretty good imagination. And I think that you know we really feel before we see. We really hear before we see. Because the information you know goes into our minds and we have towe have to reallyI mean if we're honest with ourselves if we're being ourselves we have to say OK this is how I view this. But when you have preconceptions if your vision gives you preconceptions then you've got a problem with yourself.,INTERVIEWER, Do you read Braille?,INTERVIEWEE, What is that?,INTERVIEWER, You don't read Braille?,INTERVIEWEE, I'm kidding you. Of course I read Braille yes.,INTERVIEWER, Going to play a little under me. We're going to a break. Play anything under me. Anything you wrote. My guest is Stevie Wonder. More music with Stevie as our guest. We're honoring him tonight for the full hour. Don't go away. We're back with Stevie Wonder. What a career. You toured with the Rolling Stones back in 1972.,INTERVIEWEE, Right.,INTERVIEWER, I was going to ask what was that like backstage. What was that like?,INTERVIEWEE, It was interesting. And we had a lot of fun. A lot of what I wrote for "Talking Book" the album that was very successful. Around that time I didI wrote on that tour. "Superstition" I wrote on a day off of the tour for the Stones. I mean we had a good time. We really did.,INTERVIEWER, Did you like their music?,INTERVIEWEE, We went to the Playboywas it the ,INTERVIEWER, Playboy Club.,INTERVIEWEE, To the mansion. We went to the Playboy mansion in Chicago. And at that time stupid me I took my girlfriend so whatyou know? How much trouble could I really get into? But it was great. I remember once we were performingwe performed I thinkwas itMadison Square. And there's a big crowd obviously coming to the show. And the guy said listen nobody can get in but Mick Jagger. If you're not one of the Stones you can't get through here. And so I said but this is Stevie Wonder. This is Stevie Wonder. I don't care about Stevie Who but we want Mick Jagger. If you're with the star you'll get through. I said well I am Mick Jagger. Oh you are? Why you say that? They let me through.,INTERVIEWER, Did you like their music?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes I did.,INTERVIEWER, You did. OK. When you write a song let's thinkwhere does it like"My Cheri ,INTERVIEWEE, When I do.,INTERVIEWER, "My Cheri Amour." What a beautiful song. Where did that come from?,INTERVIEWEE, That song reallyit was a song was originally called,INTERVIEWER, My Marsha?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes. My MarshaI wish that you were mine.,INTERVIEWER, So why did you change it?,INTERVIEWEE, Marsha and I broke up. And so the lyricistthe lyricist Silvia Moy wrote "My Cheri Amour." Sorry Marsha. But ,INTERVIEWER, Oh. Marsha you're sorry today aren't you? When you thinkwhen you ,INTERVIEWEE, She's probably saying well it's about (INAUDIBLE) anyway so whatever.,INTERVIEWER, When you think a song out someone has to write down all the notes right?,INTERVIEWEE, Well you know in today's technology you can play on a keyboard like this or any of the other keyboard and ,INTERVIEWER, Someone can write from it?,INTERVIEWEE, Or a piano. And through MIDI which is the technology that takes based on numbers digital information and take that information and convert that into the writing of each note that you play. The amount of beats or bars that you play the song in. So that's how it happens today. Now ,INTERVIEWER, The machine can write the note?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes there is a machine that can write or through the computer and software it can be written out.,INTERVIEWER, Are you always thinking of music? Are you always sort of writing in your head?,INTERVIEWEE, I can't say that I'm always writing in my head but I do spend a lot of time in my head writing or coming up with ideas. And what I do usually is write the music and melody and then you know maybe the basic idea. But when I feel that I don't have a song or just say God please give me another song. And I just am quiet and it happens. It's just amazing.,INTERVIEWER, Like?,INTERVIEWEE, Like,INTERVIEWER, Play something.,INTERVIEWEE, Larry we're going to miss you so don't ever go too long. If you're a woman I may have kissed you but that will never happen happen ever. Larry I remember listening to you when you interviewed James Brown on the radio. I was younger then and you were too a few years ago.,INTERVIEWER, Do you have a favorite song?,INTERVIEWEE, Favorite song. You know I always when people ask me like what is my most favorite song I quote Duke Ellington when they would ask him what's his favorite composition? And I say I haven't written it yet. Because you know there are different songs for different occasions. There's "My Cheri Amour" for a certain day there's "As" for a certain day. You know "I Just Called to Say I Love You" for a certain day happyI mean just different songs. A vision for a certain day. So I think that the blessing is that I have been able to write songs that have created so many different emotions at different times that I can connect to.,INTERVIEWER, Do you remember where it beginslike "I Just Called to Say I Love You" where did the inspiration came from?,INTERVIEWEE, I think the idea of the story came from really the spirit of you know how love is something that's for all seasons whether there'd be a holiday or not a holiday or just being able to express that place any time love is always something that can be expressed. And then for years I just had theI just called to say I love you I just called to say how much I care.,INTERVIEWER, Do the lyrics come to you right away too?,INTERVIEWEE, Well the lyric for that came from me having some words already and then putting them together in a way that worked good for the film and equally as important for the song.,INTERVIEWER, Did you know that it was going to be a hit?,INTERVIEWEE, I knew it was going to be a hit. I knew that,INTERVIEWER, I thought you would know that.,INTERVIEWEE, I knew that.,INTERVIEWER, Of course how could that not be a hit?,INTERVIEWEE, I just felt good about it all the time. I remember playing it for different times different birthdays and stuff. But I see only had some words I would just make up at the time.,INTERVIEWER, You had other words for that too?,INTERVIEWEE, I mean basically,INTERVIEWER, Was there a Marsha for that?,INTERVIEWEE, No Marsha. No Marsha.,INTERVIEWER, Have you written a song you thought would be a smash and wasn't?,INTERVIEWEE, Oh we all have that. Every single writer has a song that they think is going to be you know incredible and then,INTERVIEWER, What was one that disappointed you?,INTERVIEWEE, I think a song I did "All About the Love Again" I wrote that a while back and then recently we put it on the album for President Barack Obama for the campaign. And I remember when II wrote the song the idea of it wasthe melody was so catchy.Da da doo da Oh yeah it sounds so good to me,INTERVIEWER, How could that miss?,INTERVIEWEE, I know. What's up? Sounds good to me.,INTERVIEWER, Sounds good to me Stevie Wonder signed sealed delivered he's yours next.,INTERVIEWEE, I never dreamed in the summer but now my my love has gone away. Michael why didn't you stay? I loved Michael a lot. I just felt that the way that certain people that you know theywell here's the deal. I felt that if you're going befriend someone and God forbid they pass away then why do you come after they died to talk about their business? I was not feeling that at all.,INTERVIEWER, We're back with Stevie Wonder. I guess the song that is more singers sing nightclub performances my wife sings it. She sings a lot of club songs is "For Once In My Life".,INTERVIEWEE, Hey so you want me to write your wife a song?,INTERVIEWER, Yeah I'd love you to.,INTERVIEWEE, Are you serious?,INTERVIEWER, Yeah.,INTERVIEWEE, OK I'll do that. Seriously I will do it. And the reason I will do it because as much of some of the things that I did see when you were doing the thing about Michael Jackson kind of pissed me off a little bit-but I thought the spirit in which you kept it with integrity was great.,INTERVIEWER, Tell me about "For Once In My Life". Where did that come from? You can take it The way that went was I was in Motown in Detroit. And I was with my producer Hank Cosby at the time whoI said I've got this great idea. Obviously I heard Tony Bennett do the song when I was like maybe 12 years old 13 whatever it was 14. And I loved it you know what he did with the song. But by about 17 18 I said wow that's such a great song. Let me try to do it another way. I said Hank I've got a great idea to do this song. He said what song? I said "For Once In My Life" So I went to the studio and so I go like- What are you doing what's up? I said "Listen just listen." They said what song? I said "For Once In My Life".,INTERVIEWEE, For once in my life I have someone who needs me someone I needed so long. For once I'm unafraid I can go where life leads me somehow I know I'll be strong. For once I can touch what my heart used to dream of long before I knew oh someone warm like you would make - By the time I get to that I hear this knock on the door. And so Ron says what are you doing to my song? And I said I'm telling you Ron this is going to be a hit. He said "No no no." I said "I'm telling you this is a good way to do it." He said "OK. If I'm wrong you know I'll buy you dinner. If I'm right you buy me car-no. But any way I said "I'm telling you I feel it.",INTERVIEWER, You put your own stamp on it though.,INTERVIEWEE, I just felt that that was the way to do it. It was a song that was reallyI mean in both ways obviously it's a great song. I think part of a great song is that you're able to do various interpretations of that song.,INTERVIEWER, Yeah.,INTERVIEWEE, And so that song done like that to me it felt like what I could relate to at 17 18 years old.,INTERVIEWER, Play us to the break. We've got to go to break here. Be my tune smith.,INTERVIEWEE, You going to sing with me? Come on let's go.,INTERVIEWER, Sure let's go.,INTERVIEWEE, For once in my life I have someone that needs me someone that I've needed for so long; for once I unafraid I can go where life leads me and somehow I know I'll be strong. My heart is a dreamer long before I knew -,INTERVIEWER, We're back with Stevie Wonder. How did "Ebony and Ivory" come about?,INTERVIEWEE: Side by side on my piano keyboard oh Lord why don't we? It was a promotion person that worked for Motown for some years that reached out to someone that was working with me at the time saying that Paul McCartney had a song that he felt would be great for he and I to do together. The other person was Herb Beeker (ph) who worked in Motown right when I first got with Motown. And so you know we worked it out to connect and get together. We met in Manzerott (ph) and we recorded the song. I felt the sentiment would be something that was appropriate and I just felt that at the end of the day it really is about you know being able to you know understand that we may have differences of opinions but at the end of the day we have to come together and live and work together. Just as on my piano why can't we? So it was a great song.,INTERVIEWER, And at a Larry King Cardiac Gala we sang that song together.,INTERVIEWEE, I remember that.,INTERVIEWER, But I didn't do ivory. What did I sing?,INTERVIEWEE, You may have been ebony.,INTERVIEWER, No I was ebony and you were ivory.,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah.,INTERVIEWER, Let's see if we remember a little bit of it. I don't remember the first line.,INTERVIEWEE, Ebony. Ebony and ivory lived together in perfect harmony side by side on my piano keyboard oh Lord why can't we? Side by side on my piano keyboard oh Lord why can't we? Ebony and ivory,INTERVIEWER, How we going to top that?,INTERVIEWEE, You stopped singing in the middle of it.,INTERVIEWER, I know I gave up.,INTERVIEWEE, So when the record comes out you don't get as much as me.,INTERVIEWER, OK. How many instruments do you play?,INTERVIEWEE, Keyboards drums harmonica percussion instruments.,INTERVIEWER, Anybody you want to work with that you haven't?,INTERVIEWEE, I mean I'm a big fan of music. I'm a music lover. So there probably isn't no one that I wouldn't want to work it. I think it would come down to the chemistry. And if the chemistry was right and we had both the same feeling about working together and if they could sing or play and they didn't mind being challenged I'm good.,INTERVIEWER, Will you play "Sir Duke" to break? I need some tea. Hold on. How can we do this? One handed.,INTERVIEWEE, Music is a world within itself the language that we all understand with an equal opportunity for all to sing and clap their hands just because the record has a groove don't make it in the group but you can tell right away when the people start to move. They can feel it all over they can feel it all over people. They can feel it all over they can feel it all over people.,INTERVIEWER, All right. The crew was talking before we began this interview and they all said they love a song which is not familiar to me I've got some musical knowledge but I don't know everything. And the song is called "Part-Time Lover." What's your take on that? How did that come about?,INTERVIEWEE, How did I write the song or what?,INTERVIEWER, Yeah. Not Marsha again.,INTERVIEWEE, This would have involved a fewa couple different people. But this song I wrote when I was in England and I don't know it was just an idea. The whole thing the beat then was likeand so it was like - Call up once hang up the phone to let me knowlet me start again. Call up ring once hang up the phone to let me know you made it home. Got nothing to be wrong with part-time lover. If she's with me I'll blink the lights to let you know tonight's the night for me and you my part-time lover. Chasing love underneath the sun we are strangers by day lovers by night knowing it's so wrong but feeling so right. You know we can go on and on.,INTERVIEWER, Do you still do a lot of concerts?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes. We just recently did the tour throughout Europe. We've had different concepts. The next two I'm going to do is going to be called "Threw The Eyes of Wonder." And the concept of that tour is going to be really taking the ideas that I see you know the visuals how Ihow I've done the various songs and how I visualize various things could be with something that would be a visual. Whether it be a video whether it be staging them a certain kind of way. Because I think that you know obviously with every song that I've written I have sort of a vivid imagination or pictures as to how I view and how I see as well as the world itself.,INTERVIEWER, Through The Eyes Of Wonder what a great idea. Do you ever gethow old are you now Stevie?,INTERVIEWEE, 60.,INTERVIEWER, Hanging up the career just retiring?,INTERVIEWEE, Obviously there will be some point when I'll decide OK I've got a daughter that sings a son that sings. I've got family that you know are talented little children are very talented. And so I think you know at some point you know life will give itself to them. And by then whenever that might be I'll just not do it. Maybe just write songs or whatever. ButI love performing.,INTERVIEWER, Our remaining moments with the great Stevie Wonder. Iboy. It'sit's so unbelievable to have hadto be able to sit with people like you and to experience you firsthand for a little kid from Brooklyn.,INTERVIEWEE, If I could ask you a question how have you enjoyed you've met so many different personalities ,INTERVIEWER, I've enjoyed every minute of it.,INTERVIEWEE, Really?,INTERVIEWER, 50 years went by like yesterday. I remember the first day I started. But this is about you. So I'm going to the great Artie Shore he stopped playing at age 53. And I asked him why and he said he had nothing more to say. Do you ever feel that way?,INTERVIEWEE, For as long as there's life for as long as we have things happening in the world for as long as people haven't been able to work it out for as long as people are not trying to work it out for as long as there's crime and destruction and hate bigotry for as long as there is a spirit that does not have love in it I will always have something to say.,INTERVIEWER, Do you ever sing what Ray Charles used to sing you ever sing "America"?,INTERVIEWEE, I haven't sang the song. I like the song.,INTERVIEWER, You ought to sing "America The Beautiful".,INTERVIEWEE, OK. I think it's a very very pretty song. Certain songs you hear people sing you say you know what? I'm not going to think about touching that because in he case of Ray he did such an incredible job of it. The national anthem that Whitney Houston did incredible. And so there are various pieces that obviously in time I will do. But I think that I have an appreciation for the talents of those people that have done them incredibly. There's a song that I wrote called "Until You Come Back To Me" and my version was very sort of pop oriented a little bit. And Aretha did it Aretha Franklin did it and it was like forget about it.,INTERVIEWER, Play a little of it while we're closing out. Stevie Wonder's been our guest. "AC 360" is going to follow and the latest news on CNN. Play us out Stevie.,INTERVIEWEE, I sit and wait in vain. I love to rap on your door tap on your window pane I want to tell you baby the changes I've been going through missing you till you come back to me that's what I'm going to do.,INTERVIEWER, Good night everybody.,INTERVIEWEE, Till you come back to me that's what I'm going to do,INTERVIEWER, OK. Now you're in Orlando for a reason. She's coming to us from the Orange County Convention Center. You've earned multiple Grammys a Country Music Awards. Too numerous to mention. National Medal of the Arts Kennedy Center honoree nominated for Oscars Golden Globes and an Emmy and now Dollywood won last night the prestigious Applause Award. Tell me about that.,INTERVIEWEE, Yay.,INTERVIEWER, What is that?,INTERVIEWEE, Well actually it's aI'll show it to you. It's heavy but I wanted you to see it. Can you see that?,INTERVIEWER, It's hands applauding. Nice.,INTERVIEWEE, There.,INTERVIEWER, Nice. Nice.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes it is. And they actually give these out every other year. And this is the first time we've received it. Theyyou only get it one time. But it's really a very prestigious thing. It's really kind of like winning an Oscar in show business. But it really says that you are the number one park in the world. Not just the United States but all over the world. And it's voted on by a committee of your peers. And so we were very fortunate that we got it this year. We have a wonderful park in Dollywood wonderful people there that keep it running. And you getthey vote on it for cleanliness beauty the shows and everything that just kind of says this is a wonderful place for families and people to go. So we're very proud and very honored down here.,INTERVIEWER, How long has Dollywood been open? ,INTERVIEWEE, Well like you this is my 25th anniversary. We'reactually we've had a lot of wonderful things going on all year and we've celebrated. We had a special. And then to be able to win this to kind of top off our 25th year it was a wonderful thing. So we opened in '86.,INTERVIEWER, Dolly how did it come about? You know we've done a lot of talks in the past and Dollywood is a fabulous place. But not many country music artists have their own amusement park. How did that come about?,INTERVIEWEE, Well actually it's a theme park. But it does have amusement areas in it. And I was always fascinated with the county fair growing up back in the mountains of east Tennessee. As you know I'm from a big family. We didn't get out too much and haveyou know get to have a lot of fun. I mean as far as things like that. So when the county fair would come to town we would get to go. The school would take us so I was always impressed with that. And after I got into show business I always thought well it'd be wonderful if I could do something great for my home county provide jobs for the people in the area because it was a very rural and poor area. And really to have a place for people to go to have fun. So it started out in a very sincere way. And when we opened it was just a hit right out of the chute although a lot of my business people thought I was making a mistake. They don't think that now. But it was just a wonderful thing to do and it's just been a great thing for us.,INTERVIEWER, And it's in Penny Forge Tennessee. Now if it's in an outlying area remote area where you grew up do people have a hard time finding it?,INTERVIEWEE, Oh no. It's right on the main highway. Pigeon Forge is an areait's from Knoxville and you go right up to Gatlinburg and the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. So it's right on the main road into the national park where we have at least what 10 million people a year I suppose coming in and out of the Smoky Mountains National Park. So it's situated in a great area. It's kind of off the beaten path just a little but it's got all the signs saying Dollywood that way. But it's reallythat area has really grown a lot in the last several years. But the Smoky Mountains and Gatlinburg have always been wonderful. Sevier County is a great area. So it's just a good place to have a business.,INTERVIEWER, Were you alwaysmost singers are interested only in singing. Were you always interested in the business side of things?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes. I think I've got my business notions and my sense for that sort of thing from my dad. My dad never had a chance to go to school. He couldn't read and write. But he was so smart. He was just one of those people that could just make the most of anything and everything that he had to work with. And it was you know obvious he had to with raising 12 kids just a farmer. Later on he worked on construction. But my dad was really really smart. And I think I got a lot of that from him. And my mother's people are very creative so thankfully I had the creative stuff to make a way for myyou know for my business sense. But I enjoy the business end of things and I look at it like show business. I mean I love being in show business. But I like to look and work the business end of it as well. So when I see an opportunity I jump all over it.,INTERVIEWER, But it does add responsibility in that people work for you people are dependent on you whereas most people who are singers they travel they sing. They don't have hundreds of people responsible to make a living.,INTERVIEWEE, Well that's true. We actually are the number one employer in all of east Tennessee. We hire about 3000 people with our Dixie Stampede Dinner theaters with our Splash Country and Dollywood all the Dollywood companies there. And we've actually paid out $1 billion in salaries since we started Dollywood. But I do enjoy being part of all that. I haveI have surrounded myself with very smart people. I certainly wouldn't claim to be able to do all that myself. But at least I'm smart enough to know I've got to get good smart people to help with all of those things. And I have wonderful partners and wonderful people that help with all of that and make me look good.,INTERVIEWER, Do you think you were driven by the fact that you were raised so poor?,INTERVIEWEE, I think so. I think that I know the value of a dollar. I know that I always wanted things. I was always proud of my people proud of my home but I always wanted more. I think most people do. And not just for myself but for my family as well. I wanted to do well to make them proud as well as being able to help out. And so I think that a lot of that did come from not having anything growing up. But it's wonderful to still be able to go home be a part of all that and have all the people in the county love me and appreciate me. And you know it makes me feel like I've stayed at home and that I have people that are proud of me. Not just my own family but everybody in the whole area. I just feel like I'm still part of them and they're part of me. ,INTERVIEWER, We're back with Dolly Parton. Do you remember your first paycheck?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes I do. I still have my first paycheck. It was just I think a dollar or two that I got when I started as a songwriter with BMI and I had some songs there that I had through the company and in the mail I got this big old check for like a dollar and a half or something. Somebody had recorded one of my songs. So somewhere in my things I haveI have my first check.,INTERVIEWER, Are you always writing songs?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes. I write a lot of songs. I've got thousands of songs. I really haven't counted them. People always ask me that. Years and years ago someone asked me. I said probably two or 3000 but I'm sure there's many hundreds more now because I love to write. It's my favorite thing that I do. And I justit's my way of expressing myself. It's a way to express the feelings of people I love that are not able to put it down on paper or rhyme it in words. So it's a great outlet and it's fun. It's a hobby a joy and a job.,INTERVIEWER, What was your first hit?,INTERVIEWEE, My first hit. I guess the first big hitI did not write. My first radio record was a song Curly Putman wrote. It was my first top 10 record. It was called "Dumb Blondes" which I've become kind of famous for. But actually I started writing songs during that period of time myself. But the first big songs that I started having would be "Jolene" and the original version of "I Will Always Love You" "Coat of Many Colors." All of those wereI think "Code of Many Colors" was in the late '60s. That was one of the very first hits that I had.,INTERVIEWER, All right.,INTERVIEWEE, "Tennessee Mountain Home" and then the '70s brought "Jolene" and "I Will Always Love you" and some other songs you recognize.,INTERVIEWER, "I Will Always Love You" has been covered a lot hasn't it?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes it has. That's been the biggest moneymaking song that I've ever had. Of course Whitney Houston made it such a popular record from "The Bodyguard" movie and Kevin Costner had chosen that song to use in the movie. And so it became world famous and it's known as the number one love song in all the world which makes me feel very proud to be part of that. But yes that one has been around a while.,INTERVIEWER, Last time you were here Barack Obama had just been sworn in as president. You said that you were excited thought he'd do great.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, How is he doing?,INTERVIEWEE, Well he's certainly not as popular now as he was then but I'm still praying for him. I'm still hoping that he does well. It's justthese are hard times. I don't think it would matter who is in the White House. I think we're going to always crucify them andbecause if we can't make it happen overnight then we'reyou know we just don't know what to do. So I'm just hoping that whoever is in the White House at any time you know just tries to help you know the country just do better. So I'm for anybody that's trying to help us out. And I think he's trying.,INTERVIEWER, Do you ever lookyou look at your upbringing you look at all that's happened to you. Do you ever look in the mirror and kind of pinch yourself?,INTERVIEWEE, Well I do feel very fortunate. When I look in the mirror that's not what I'm thinking. I pinch myself here and pinch myself there. Say what can I pull up? Maybe that needs to go. But anyway I do pinch myself sometimes thinking that you know this is really amazing. I thank God every day for it. I'm very humbled by it because I know so many people that have had the same dreams that I've had that never get to see them come true. So I know a certain amount of it is luck. A lot of it is hard work. I've been very fortunate. I do work hard and I've always said I have more guts than talent but I try to keep those two things balanced and I try when I have a dream to kind of get it out there and push ityou know push it on through.,INTERVIEWER, I understand you're doing the movie "Joyful Noise" with Queen Latifah. Tell me about it.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes I'm very excited about that. It's a Warner Brothers picture and we have been in L.A. together for the last couple of weeks. We've been working on some pre-records for the music. We really liked each other a lot. Our personalities are very compatible which I thought they would be. I knew I would love working with her. And I had never met her though until then. We'd talked on the phone after we started talking about doing the movie. But our voices blended really well. Our personalities seemed to really you know gel. So I think we're going to have a lot of fun doing it and it looks like it's going to be a wonderful show. It was written and will be directed by a guy named Todd Graf. And he's done a wonderful script. It's aboutit's a music-driven movie. It's not a musical but it's got a lot of music gospel uplifting songs. And so it's about a choir that competes around the country with different choirs. So it's got a lot of fun a lot of music a lot of joy and I think it's going to make people feel real good once they leave the theater provided they come which we hope they do.,INTERVIEWER, We're back with Dolly Parton. We're looking forward to seeing "Joyful Noise" where she costars with Queen Latifah. Why so long between movies? You know you had such a hit. We'll talk about "9 to 5" in a while. Why didn't you get more films?,INTERVIEWEE, Well I don't really get a lot of good scripts. And I get a lot of junk come across my desk and you know into our offices. But I really am looking for something good. And when this one came along it just seemed to be so perfect because I think the writer wrote it for her and for me specifically and that's why you know we were really ready to go pretty soon after we both read the script and said yes we love it. Yes we love each other. Yes we'd love to do it. So it was just one of those things. I usually wait for things to come. I don't try to beat my brains out over it. I want to do things that's close enough to my personality to where I can carry it off. And I get a lot of stuff that I just don't think I'm a good enough actress to do it or it's just junk and I don't want to do it. So I've been lucky with the movies that I have done and this one hopefully will be one of most fun ones.,INTERVIEWER, Do you duet with Queen Latifah a lot?,INTERVIEWEE, Well actually we do sing in the choir of and on together. But yes we have one duet song that I wrote. And it actually is the front of the movie. So we do get to kind of banter back and forth and kind of sing against each other and kind of get our frustrations and our joys and our fun out you know toward each other. So our voices blend really well and I'm very excited about that.,INTERVIEWER, Your most famous film which will live forever in film lore is "9 to 5". Did you think that would be the hit it became?,INTERVIEWEE, No. Well you never know what's going to be a hit.,INTERVIEWER, Of course.,INTERVIEWEE, It's just like when you write songs. You hope they're all going to be a hit and think they're going to be great but I did not know what that one would be. That was as you know the very first movie I had ever done. I had never even seen a movie made at that time or been around that. So that was kind of like a first love. It will always be the most special I'm sure as far as that goes. But it was a wonderful thing and I've worked that "9 to 5" job for 30 years now. That came out 30 years ago and of course I got to write music for a Broadway musical of it and now we're on the road. The road tour started in September in Nashville. So now it's going to be all around the country. So it's just still kicking along there.,INTERVIEWER, I remember right before the musical opened itit played five months. You got mixed reviews. Have you changed a little for the touring company?,INTERVIEWEE, Well actually wethe music's all the same. My songs stayed the same. Luckily the music got good reviews and I guess itlike you say it got mixed reviews in different areas. But weit's not as high tech as it was on Broadway. The road show of course you can't travel with all that equipment. And I don't know if you actually saw the Broadway show or not. I didn't. There was a lot of high tech stuff. But we've kind of narrowed it down to where it's really more sensible and it fits the road more and it's more like office stuff. So it's different. We still have a wonderful cast great singers. So I'm very proud of it and I enjoyed you know being on Broadway seeing that come you know to fruition. And I'm just glad toyou know to just have it still going. I don't know how long it will go. It's kind of like the Energizer bunny. It just keeps on going.,INTERVIEWER, Did itdoes it sting you when you get a poor review?,INTERVIEWEE, Well it always hurts you when you don't get theyou know the good reviews but you try to learn from it. I learned years ago if you have fall under that and just blame the critics or the person criticizing you you're never going to learn and grow from that. So I've learned through the years to look and see what they say and to see if there is truth in it. And usually there is some truth. Sometimes they overdo it. They don't have to be so honest. But anyway I just try to learn from that and apply you know what I've learned from it to whatever the next project may be. Of course we want everything to be a hit but that's just not how it goes is it?,INTERVIEWER, All right. Queen Latifah she came to fame in the hip-hop world. Do you relate to that kind of music?,INTERVIEWEE, Well I have to be honest with you. I don't really have a lot of time to relate to any kind of music even my own because I'm so busy writing stuff and working on my own things and of course country music and gospel music is my favorite. But I appreciate all kinds of music. And every age has its own style of music. Every generation. And you know I think itsome of it is fun. I just don't know that much about it. But I have a feeling I may get hip-hopped a lot now that I'm working with her. She mayI may learn to love it. Who knows?,INTERVIEWER, "Joyful Noise" that's about a gospel choir as you said.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, You were inducted into the Country Gospel Hall of Fame earlier this year elected into the Gospel Music Association's Gospel Music Hall of Fame in 2009. And you said your music has been almost like a ministry. Can you explain that?,INTERVIEWEE, Well I'm saying my work itself is likealmost like my ministry. You know it's likeI feel like that you're out there trying to help people feel better about themselves trying to give them some hope. And even when things are the hardest I try to write songs to lift people up. That's one reason I think that this "Joyful Noise" is going to be wonderful. Queen Latifah and Ior Dana is her real name. We've talked a lot about how this is a great opportunity to make people feel better about themselves. And she grew up with a religious background. I think her people werea lot of them very church people and worked in the choirs and some deaconesssomebody in her family she was joking about. So she grew up in the church with gospel music also. So I grew up that way and I've always recorded you know songsyou know that are of a more spiritual nature. So I reallyor at least some uplifting qualities or try to. So hopefully this is going to be a wonderful thing. And yes I'm honored to be part of the hall of fame. We have the Southern Gospel Hall of Fame housed at Dollywood and we're very proud of that.,INTERVIEWER, We're back with Dolly Parton winner of this year's coveted Applause Award. By the way when will we see "Joyful Noise"?,INTERVIEWEE, Well we're hoping that it will come out either byat the very end of next year 2011 or early in the 2012. So we'reyou know they're hopeful that they might get it done in 2011 but we're not sure about that and I probably shouldn't be taking liberties to talk about when it's going to be released but we're hoping it might come out next year. If not it will be soon after that.,INTERVIEWER, All right. Aren'tyour grandfather as I understand was a Pentecostal preacher. Did he have any feelingspoor feelings about you going into show business?,INTERVIEWEE, Well early on my grandpa as you know the Pentecostal Churchyou may or may not know they're pretty strict on how you dress,INTERVIEWER, I know.,INTERVIEWEE,and how you wear your hair and wearing makeup. And so I think early on I was pretty open-minded myself about myself. And I was always you know having all the makeup. And I think my grandpa and a lot of my family worried a little bit at the start thinking maybe I was going to hell in a hand basket. But it's like everything else. As soon as I started getting famous and people seemed to love me and I seemed to be touching peoplemy grandpa was one of the first to say how proud he was of me especially after a wrote a song about him called "Daddy was An Old- Time Preacher Man." So he would always justmy grandpa would just go downtown and justyou know just tap people on the shoulder. He'd say you know that song "Daddy was An Old-Time Preacher Man"? Well that's about me. So anyhow he kind of came around ,INTERVIEWER, Yes that'll change you.,INTERVIEWEE, You know after he saw that I was OK. Yes. But he was proud of me.,,INTERVIEWER, You have said that you are Miley Cyrus's fairy godmother and you were recently on her Disney show "Hannah Montana." She has been criticized recently for wearing risque outfits and raunchy dancing. You want to comment on that?,INTERVIEWEE, Well I don't want to say a whole lot about that. Hopefully she didn't get that from me because I certainly never encouraged her to do any of that. But I think Miley is special. I think she's very talented. I think she's just in a crossshe's just kind of in a crosswinds trying to overcome the Hannah Montana little girl and trying to become a young woman. And I think she's justyou know I don't know if she's surrounded by people that are helping you know not make the wise decisions but I know that she's going to be fine or I certainly hope so. I never try to give people advice. I never wanted people giving me advice. I wanted information and I wanted to be left alone to do my own thing. So I'm hoping that Miley is going to be just fine. I know she's very gifted and I love her dearly and if she ever needs me I'll do everything I can to help her in any way that I can. So I think we should just let her grow up.,INTERVIEWER, Do you think your business is tougher on young girls?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes. I think it is. I think this day and time life is hard for young people certainly young girls. I think wethings just scare me to death anymore. I'm just so glad I don't have children now because I think that it would just be really hard to know how to direct them to know what to say because the world is justyou just can't flaunt enough. You can't just do enough. You can't just talk trashy enough or dress trashy enough. It seems to be like if you don't do that you're not in the in crowd. So I think that there's a lot of pressure just on young people in general and I think they put a lot of pressure on themselves as well trying to compete or thinking that they're supposed to be like the stars on TV. And I worry that a lot of kids are not really finding their own core their own selves. They're own identity. They're trying to be like somebody else. So I don't worry about that for my nieces and nephews and just for young people in general.,INTERVIEWER, Back in 1978 Dolly Parton was Country Music Association's Entertainer of the Year. She was also a pop crossover artist at the time becoming a major major hit. Last year at age 21 Taylor Swift became the youngest ever to be named Entertainer of the Year by the Country Music Association. She also won Female Vocalist Album of the Year Video of the Year. What do you make of her?,INTERVIEWEE, I say yay Taylor Swift. I think she is a smart beautiful girl. I think she's making all the right moves. She's got a good head on her shoulders. She's surrounded with wonderful people. Her songs are great. She keeps herself anchored. She knows who she is and she's living and standing by that. And I just admire her. I think she is just incredible and a great role model for young people right now.,INTERVIEWER, You think there's a danger Dolly in too much too soon?,INTERVIEWEE, In too much consumed you say?,INTERVIEWER, No too muchgetting too much attention. Too much awards too soon ,INTERVIEWEE, Oh getting much too soon.,INTERVIEWER, Yes.,INTERVIEWEE, Well it's just sort of like when they talk about "American Idol" you know they say well you know they show up and then they're gone before it happens. And there is a danger in all of that. But with Taylor I honestly think that she's got the qualities that could last a long time. I think she's got a good head on her shoulders. And I don't know if there's such a thing as having too much too soon. I mean if it's your time it's your time. You shouldn't deny somebody you know what they can have. So I'm hoping that she's just having a really really hot streak that's just going to last. I hope her 15 minutes of fame lasts for 40 years and it very well might.,INTERVIEWER, What keeps country music keeping on? I think it's still the most popular idiom form in America.,INTERVIEWEE, Well I think country music is popularhas been popular and will always be popular because I think a lot of real people singing about a lot of real stuff about real people. And it's simple enough for people to understand it. And we kind of roll with the punches. I believe there will always be that traditional country that I grew up with the Kitty Wells and the Hank Williams. I think there will always be those kind of people and the people that love you know the mountain and bluegrass. And I think it's great though that folks like Taylor SmithSmithTaylor Swift can come along and actually take it into other areas and do whatever you know they can with it. And Brad Paisley and all those wonderful people Keith Urban. They really have a good country core with all those great country instrumentsbanjos fiddles and mandolins. And so I think it's great that it's a flexibleit's a flexible music.,INTERVIEWER, Do you think the lyric are harder to write? Do you think people like Cole Porter and Irving Berlin could have written country?,INTERVIEWEE, Well I think a lot of the Cole Porter songs and Irving Berlin I think those songsthey're not that different from country music as far as what they're saying. They are simple stories simple truths about love or feelings and thoughts. But I think it's just the difference in instrumentation and then how you perform it or how you sing it. But a good song is a good song. Doesn't matter who wrote it. You can take an Irving Berlin song and add bluegrass. I even did "I Get a Kick Out of You" years ago ,INTERVIEWER, Cole Porter.,INTERVIEWEE, I bluegrassed it up and a lot ofyes the Cole Porter song. And people got a lot ofyou know got a kick out of me singing "I Get a Kick Out of You.",INTERVIEWER, I get a kick out of you Dolly. How do youyou write so many songs. How do you get inspired?,INTERVIEWEE, Well everything inspires me. You inspire me which by the way I'm so happy that I got to be on your show. We're both celebrating our 25th anniversaries. But I loveyou know I love being around people. I love hearing what smart people like you have to say. I watch you interview other people. Sometimes people will say a line or say something and I think wow that will be a good idea for a song. So I justyou know I just pick up things from just day-to- day living and it's just easy for me to write about it.,INTERVIEWER, All right. Do you like hearingdo you like it when other people are singing your songs?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes I do. A lot ofa lot of singers or a lot of songwriters I've heard say I hated how they did my song. They have it in their head a certain way. But I'm just happy for anybody to do one of my songs however they want to do it because I'm curious to see all the different ways that people can do a song. Just like when Whitney did my simple song ,INTERVIEWER, Yes.,INTERVIEWEE,of "I Will Always Love You" and look what she did. It was mighty. David Foster did this spectacular arrangement on that. And I just thought wow is that my little song? And I just think it's amazing. So I'm thrilled even when there's songs recorded of mine that don't do as well or some say I hated that version of your song. I like them because I'm honored and flattered that people want to do them.,INTERVIEWER, Dolly Parton on her new CD by the way duets with the great Norah Jones. You've sung together before at the CMA awards. What make itwhat makes a duet work and why sometimes does it not work when we have two really good artists?,INTERVIEWEE, Well that's a very good question. I've been very successful with duet partners like with Porter Wagner when I started with him the man that actually helped me get started big time in country music. And then Kenny Rogers our voices just blend and our personalities mesh. But I have sung songs with other people and it's not like that. And Norah Jones I love her. Our voices really did work. So it's really hard to say. You just never know. People just kind of haveKenny Rogers and me justwe might as well be married. People just think we're supposed to be together all the time. So it's just a matter of I think the personalities and the tones and the qualities in a voice with my little thin high voice and Kenny's rich quality it seemed to work. It was the same with Porter. And when I sang with Emmylou Harris and Linda Ronstadt that's a beautiful blend. But it's justyou just never know until you kind of luck up on it one day with a great duet partner.,INTERVIEWER, Did you want to be on the Sinatra duets album? They should have put you on that.,INTERVIEWEE, Nobody asked me to be on it.,INTERVIEWER, That would have been fun.,INTERVIEWEE, Sowell I don't know. I guess they thought maybe too country or maybe they didn't have a spot for me. But that would have beenI guess it would have depended on who I sang with.,INTERVIEWER, Yes. All right. Your last ,INTERVIEWEE, I did do aI'm sorry.,INTERVIEWER, Go ahead. Go ahead.,INTERVIEWEE, I was going to say I did do a duet with Rod Stewart on one of those classic old songs that "Baby It's Cold Outside." I did that a few years back. That was a fun thing to do with him.,INTERVIEWER, I love that song.,INTERVIEWEE, Somebody else could have done it better but nobody would have enjoyed it more than I did.,INTERVIEWER, Tour last album was in 2008 "Backwoods Barbie." What's next?,INTERVIEWEE, Well I'm glad you asked. I have a brand new CD that I'm working on now that will also be on my label Dolly Records. And it's going to come out in early summer. I haven't got a title just yet but I'm writing all the songs for that. Then I'm going to be going on tour in late July and early August. I'm going to be in the United States. Then we're going to be going to Europe and to Australia in fall and winter. So we're still kind of working on the scheduling. And any new information anybody wants to know follow along and keep up to date just contact us at Dollypartonmusic.net. And we'll have all the information on all the stuff we're doing. So I'm looking forward to a new CD and a new tour.,INTERVIEWER, We're back with the great Dolly Parton. What do you think it is your tie-in with the gay community?,INTERVIEWEE, Well I have a lot of gay fans female and male. And I think I've been at this so long a lot of people feel like they've grown up with me. As you know I've always been outspoken I've always been pretty outrageous I always believe that a person should be who they are. And you should be comfortable being who you are and people should leave you alone to be who you are in how you are. So I think I've always been accepted in the gay community because I accept them. And I have so many fans that always love to come to the shows and they know that I'm not judging them. I think people are who they are and I'm not God I'm not a judge we're supposed to love each other exactly for who and what we are.,INTERVIEWER, Why do you think there is hostility toward gays? Why are gays bullied?,INTERVIEWEE, Well I'm not sure about all of the reasons that people act the way they do about other people. I just think we need to dig down a little deeper and try to be a little kinder to one another and accept one another foryou know for who we are. I mean you can't tell me that people are any way other than what they're supposed to be. I don't think gay people are trying to just be different just to make other people miserable. I think people are being who they are and I think they arethey should be who they are. And I think we should be a little more tolerant a little more accepting and understanding of not just the gays but other people. Minorities. We just don't have enough love to reallyto live in this world.,INTERVIEWER, But ,INTERVIEWEE, We really need to. And that's one ofone of the songs that I wrote for the "Joyful Noise" musical. It's called "Not Enough Love" andor it's called "Not Enough." And that's the duet that I sang with Queen Latifah and we really enjoyed singing it. It's likeit's just saying you know why can't we be more accepting and loving and tolerant?,INTERVIEWER, Butdidn't you grow up where you grew up around segregation?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes. Actually and I didn't knowwe didn't know any blacks or Hispanics or any of those people growing up. I grew up way back in the mountains. The first black person I ever saw was when I went to high school at Severe County High School when I started in 1960. And the first black people we knewthere were about four black students in our school. And there was a girl in our class and her name was Parton. So they used to kid me all the time. They were saying is this your sister? I said well yes she is. And so it was likeso we hadI was the Parton there and right next to me in our yearbook is like the other Parton and she's black and white. I thought well that'd a God smile right there. And then like when I was working with Queen Latifah her name is Dana Owens and my mother's maiden name is Owens too. And so I said there I said look my first black friend was a Parton and now my next black friend or close friend if we get to be that close is an Owens. So I said we are sisters. We're all sisters and brothers anyway. So I thought that was just a cuteyes.,INTERVIEWER, Speaking ofspeaking of sisters and brothers you were one of 12 children but you never had children of your own. Ever regret that?,INTERVIEWEE, No. This day and time I regret it even less. I used to think I wanted children but I don't have children now. But I tell you looking at the way this world is now it's like I'm almost glad I don't. It'sI worry enough about my brothers and sisters and their children and my little nieces and nephews and just other people's children. I just you know hope that they allyou know do great. And so I make a perfect aunt. I get a chance to keep them take them toyou know to Dollywood. They love that. Or take themtake them to one of our Dixie Stampede Dinner Theaters which I forgot to mention. We've got a new pirate theme at one of our Dixie Stampedes in Myrtle Beach this next year and I got to write all the music for that and I can't wait to takeyou know the kids to go see all that. So I make a better aunt than I would have a mother I think.,INTERVIEWER, Couple of moments left with Dolly Parton. Your husband Carl Dean stays in the background. Is that by his design?,INTERVIEWEE, Oh absolutely. My husband loves staying home. He does not want to be in the limelight. He's proud of me. He wants me to do anything I want to do that makes me happy as long as I just don't hit on him. I did make him go see "9 to 5" when the show came to Nashville. He wouldn't go to Broadway but I did just kind of grab him and say you're going with me. Actually he went to the dress rehearsal. He wouldn't go you know with the whole crowd there. So he doesn't like to be in the limelight but he's a great guy. We've been married for 42 years now I guess soa long time.,INTERVIEWER, And what got you sowhat got you so involvedyou give time and money to the cause of literacy.,INTERVIEWEE, Thewe're so proud of our Imagination Library. That's where we give books to children. Started in my home county where we give a book to children from the time they're born once a month until they start kindergarten. It was such a big hit that the Governor Phil Bredesen in Tennesseein Nashville he took over and we just turned the whole thing into bigger and better then we were all over Tennessee now we're all over the United States in Canada and in England. So we just love working with the kids and I think God knew I probably shouldn't have kids of my own so everybody's kids could be mine and I could help in all the ways that I can. So that makes me feel real good and it was based on the fact that a lot of my own relatives didn't get a chance to get an education. So that whole thing worked out really well. And so Iit's something I take a lot of pride in.,INTERVIEWER, Did you have a book affect you in childhood?,INTERVIEWEE, Did I ever what?,INTERVIEWER, A book.,INTERVIEWEE, I'm sorry.,INTERVIEWER, You ever have a book had an impact on you?,INTERVIEWEE, Oh yes. Actually the book that had the most impact on me is the book that we give out the very first book in the Imagination Library. It's that wonderful little book that everybody knows called "The Little Engine That Could." And I like to look at myself and think I am a little engine that did. I think we all can if we think we can and if we get out there and do it. So that's a wonderful little book and a wonderful little message.,INTERVIEWER, Dolly congratulations on the Applause Award and everything else on the tour new album and the movie. Keep on keeping on Dolly.,INTERVIEWEE, Well I will and congratulations to you. We're going to miss the tar out of you. So I'll see you somewhere else though.,INTERVIEWER, Down the road.,INTERVIEWEE, Thank you Larry.,INTERVIEWER, Thanks Dolly.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, Dolly Parton.,INTERVIEWEE, Thank you.,INTERVIEWER, All right Larry thank you very much. And imam thank you very much for talking with us.,INTERVIEWEE, Thank you Soledad.,INTERVIEWER, You're just back from the Middle East. You've been gone for about two months. And you've been pretty quiet about the controversy that has been raging about the proposed structure right near Ground Zero. The debate while you've been gone has gotten louder. And it's gotten angrier. Why are you talking now?,INTERVIEWEE, Well I didn't think it was appropriate for me to speak about this while I was overseas on the trip. I felt I wanted to come home and speak to this issue from my home country from my homeland from my home base.,INTERVIEWER, You've had questions while you've been in the Middle East about the controversy that's swirling in Lower Manhattan. What kind of things are people there asking you about what's happening here?,INTERVIEWEE, Well they're very concerned about many things. They're concerned about the status of Muslims in America. And in the Gulf where I was which is a very important part for our own national security. Bahrain is the home of the 5th fleet. We have a very important naval base there. Qatar is the place of an important air base that we have there. And the concerns of people there are both about what this means not only within the United States but also what this means for them,INTERVIEWER, What the debate means you mean?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes indeed. Because the United States we are the only global superpower today. What happens here has enormous impact over the rest of the world. People all over the Muslim world admire America love America take America as an example in many many respects. And the status of Muslims in America and how American Muslims speak to these issues and how America engages with its Muslim community has global ramifications.,INTERVIEWER, And the big debate really is over how Muslims have engaged with the American community. You're living that right now. So let's walk back to the very beginning. When did you settle upon this location which is just about two blocks north of Ground Zero for your new Islamic cultural center? Why that particular spot?,INTERVIEWEE, Well first I must remind everybody that I have been imam of a mosque just 10 blocks from that spot 12 blocks from Ground Zero. I've been serving that community and that neighborhood for the last quarter of a century. When 9/11 happened we couldn't reach our mosque in the Tribeca area. You know and finally we came back. There was flower letters. We're part of this community. I've served this community. And this is a community that I have worked for so long. And is important for us as Muslims as Muslims who are in Lower Manhattan to want to give back to the city and the country that's given us so much.,INTERVIEWER, So why that particular spot?,INTERVIEWEE, Well what happened was Sharif Gamal the owner of Soho Properties a member of my congregation has noticed how ourthe need for prayer space has expanded. He felt a commitment to do something for his community. And he found this particular building. And he negotiated it acquired it and offered it for us to use and to establish a center that would be the space for a vision that I've had for over a decade or 15 almost 20 years which is to establish a space which embodies the fundamental beliefs that we have as Jews Christians and Muslims which is to love our god and to love our neighbor to build a space where we'll have a culture of worship. And at the same time get to know each other and to forge personal bonds because that's how society how community is built and how we can create something that will snowball to push back against the radical discourse that has just hijacked the discourse in our country and in much of the world.,INTERVIEWER, What's been created has snowballed a little bit. There's a lot of anger and hostility at that site. And there are many people who have said why not just go somewhere else?,INTERVIEWEE, I understand the sensitivity of the people. I really do. And I'm very very concerned about it. We've reached out and are still reaching out to 9/11 families.,INTERVIEWER, Did you reach out to them before?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, To all the families?,INTERVIEWEE, Not to all the families but to as many as we could reach especially those who are very concerned about this issue.,INTERVIEWER, Before you started the proposal?,INTERVIEWEE, No not before we started but once this thing happened. I need to remind the audience that this story first broke last December in "The New York Times." It was a front page article in "The New York Times." And no one objected. This controversy only began in May. And it began as a result of some politicians who decided to use this for certain political purposes. And this is when it began to snowball Soledad.,INTERVIEWER, So you think it's been politicized?,INTERVIEWEE, Absolutely. This is very dangerous and tragic for two reasons. Reason number one is that it goes against the fundamental American principle of separation of church and state. This concept of separation of religion and politics or church and state has a wisdom behind it. And the purpose behind it is not to politicize religion. Because when you politicize religion it is dangerous.,INTERVIEWER, But ultimately when you look at the polls something like 71 percent of Americans think that even though there's a right to build there a center that will include a mosque and other things which we'll talk about in a minute the wisdom of it may not be there.,INTERVIEWEE, Well here's the,INTERVIEWER, Is that political?,INTERVIEWEE, Well here,INTERVIEWER, Or is that just people saying it's sensitivity wise it's the wrong thing to do?,INTERVIEWEE, I am extremely concerned about sensitivity. But I also have a responsibility. If we move from that location the story will be that the radicals have taken over the discourse. The headlines in the Muslim world will be that Islam is under attack. And I'm less concerned about the radicals in America than I'm concerned about the radicals in the Muslim world.,INTERVIEWER, But isn't that also saying you're less concerned about the voices of opposition here?,INTERVIEWEE, And if we dono no no no. I'm sorry I don't mean it that way. I meant it the danger from the radicals in the Muslim world to our national security to the national security of our troops. I have a niece who works in the Army and served in Iraq. The concern for American citizens who live and work and travel overseas will increasingly be compromised if the radicals are strengthened. And if we do move it will strengthen the argument of the radicals to recruit their ability to recruit and their increasing aggression and violence against our country.,INTERVIEWER, There are Ground Zero families that I've spoken to who are on all sides of the debate. I mean they're not of one voice as you well know. They've said but what about me? I can't find my son's body. And they want to build a mosque on a spot where he might be.,INTERVIEWEE, Well first of all this is not thethis is not that spot. This is not Ground Zero proper. This is,INTERVIEWER, It's two blocks.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes. No one's body is in that location. I'm very sensitive to those feelings. As an imam as any religious person does we have to minister to the pain and hurt of our congregations and our ministry and our communities. And it is part of our intention. This is why we're reaching out more to 9/11 families. We would like to have a memorial in this center for 9/11 families. Congregations and our ministry and our communities. And it is part of our intention. This is why we're reaching out to 9/11 families. We would like to have a memorial in this center for 9/11 families. We have not finalized all our plans yet. We are willing to sit down and engage and do something that will help us heal. You cannot heal a trauma by walking away from it. We have to sit down. We have to talk about it. We have to dialogue about it and find a way to move through it and beyond it.,INTERVIEWER, Welcome back everybody. We're talking to Imam Feisal. And we'll continue our conversation. Did you think this was going to be controversy? Are you surprised?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, Really?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes. As I said the story first came out inlast December in "The New York Times." no one objected. ,INTERVIEWER, Is it an indication that the bridges you've been building maybe aren't such strong bridges and I know you talked about being a bridge builder a lot if you weren't aware of the controversy that would follow?,INTERVIEWEE, Well as I mentioned the story first broke out in last December. It was front page news in "The New York Times." No one objected to our establishing such a center. Rabbi Schneider (ph) was quoted. Rabbi Joy Levitt of the Jewish Community Center with whom we had spoken and who welcomed the idea and has given us enormous cooperation and support in telling us what works what doesn't work how to do this. Because the idea Soledad is to establish something like a Muslim "Y." you have the YMCA was created 130 years ago to improve relationships between what was then called the American Protestant religions by having young men and young womenof course it was separate at the time YMCA YWCA come and you know bond by doing sports together and other programs together. It's become a worldwide phenomenon. The 92nd street "Y" was the first attempt by the Jewish community to create also a center where you would create this kind of bonding. We are now today where the Jewish community and the Catholic community was maybe 70 years ago a century ago. And this is our time and our turn to do that. A Christian friend of mine once said you know I have no reason to go to a synagogue. But by going to the 92nd street "Y" and by doing its programs I've learned far more about Jewish culture. Gotten to make many Jewish friends. And it has opened my eyes to many things.,INTERVIEWER, There have been,INTERVIEWEE, So we need to do something like this because the need today is to build those types of relationships to forge those bonds that would help us create an atmosphere of peace.,INTERVIEWER, But doesn't the controversy that has happened now work against that? Isn't that exactly the opposite of what you're striving for?,INTERVIEWEE, In some ways yes. But in some ways it also is a silver lining here.,INTERVIEWER, How is it a silver lining?,INTERVIEWEE, It give us an opportunity to speak about this subject in a manner that is sober in a manner that is coherent to look at what we are all about as Americans to look about what it means to be Muslim in America to look at how we are going to put back this genie of clash between the West and Muslim world back into the bottle.,INTERVIEWER, There are plenty of Muslims as I've been doing research who have said this debate does not help us. This debate makes things more dangerous for us. This debate hurts us what's happening at Ground Zero.,INTERVIEWEE, There is no doubt that this has become such a situation. And I'm deeply sensitive to that and very concerned about that. And you know had I known this would happen we certainly would never have done this.,INTERVIEWER, You would never have picked that spot?,INTERVIEWEE, We would not have done something that would create more divisiveness.,INTERVIEWER, Then why is it hard to back up and say and now that we've done it let's undo it let's just say we won't. Let's pick another spot that's been offered?,INTERVIEWEE, As I just mentioned our national security now hinges on how we negotiate this how we speak about it and what we do. It is important for us now to raise the bar on our conversation,INTERVIEWER, What's the risk? When you say "national security" what's the risk?,INTERVIEWEE, As I mentioned because if we move that means the radicals have shaped the discourse. The radicals will shape the discourse on both sides. And those of us who are moderates on both sidesyou see Soledad the battle front is not between Muslims and non-Muslims. The real battle front is between moderates on all sides of all the faith traditions and the radicals on all sides. The radicals actually feed off each other. And in some kind of existential way need each other. And the more that the radicals are able to control the discourse on one side it strengthens the radicals on the other side and vice versa. We have to turn this around.,INTERVIEWER, Let me play a question from an i-reporter. Her name is Cathy Cortson (ph). And she's in Fullerton California. Let's listen. Why couldn't you find anotheranother place? I just feel like there's an ulterior motive. And I know that's probably wrong but that's how I feel. And I think a lot of Americans feel that way too. That you want to upset us for some reason. Is that true?,INTERVIEWEE, No it's not true. It is not our intention to create more conflict. This is our intention to say we as Muslims we as American Muslims want to contribute to the rebuilding of Lower Manhattan. We want to enhance relationships with our American non-Muslim fellow countrymen. We want to forge better relationships. And we want to be part of the solution. Not only want to be we are ready. We are willing. And we are able to be part of the solution. If the problem is perceived to lie in the Muslim community which definitely a certain amount of that is if the problem is perceived as a matter of religion then wethen the solution also lies in our being engaged in this process. We are not going to achieve peace between the West and the Muslim world without the engagement of Muslims and Western Muslims in particular.,INTERVIEWER, You can see the police officer there. That is the location of this proposed Islamic center. I was there yesterday. People carrying placards are walking by. We're back with Imam Feisal. Nice to have you. Feisal excuse me. Nice to have you. Wouldn't it further the goal of peacemaking and you've talked a lot about it to move it? Why is that an option that's of the table now?,INTERVIEWEE, Nothing is off the table Soledad.,INTERVIEWER, It's not off the table?,INTERVIEWEE, But we are consulting. We're talking to various people about how to do this so that we negotiate the best and the safest option. As I mentioned,INTERVIEWER, What are those conversations like? What's on the table?,INTERVIEWEE, The biggest issue is the national security issue.,INTERVIEWER, How do you pull out without looking like you've lost?,INTERVIEWEE, Without making it look likewithout making it look both in this country and in the Muslim world. You must remember Soledad and Americans must remember that what we do is watched all over the world all over the world. And we are very engaged with the Muslim world very engaged. And our security is really number one. Our national security our personal security is extremely important. And this issue has become now a national security issue. And therefore in our conversations in our decision making process we have to weigh many many factors and that has been dominant among them.,INTERVIEWER, Is there a middle ground that has you pull out of the center and do something else? That's what it sounds like you're saying. Is it possible?,INTERVIEWEE, We are discussing many things right now. But you know we haven't found yet an option that would work in a safe way.,INTERVIEWER, What are what you're considering it?,INTERVIEWEE, As I said we consider everything in life. But we have to be very cautious here because the voices of the radicals have ratcheted up. And we must make sure that the moderates take over the conversation.,INTERVIEWER, In your op-ed in "The New York Times" a lot of what you talked about were interfaith worship centers.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, It's a change from what was on the website originally. Is this a change in the face of the controversy? Is this the negotiation?,INTERVIEWEE, When I found the Cordoba initiative after 9/11 in response to a perennial question was how can we fix this relationship between the United States and the Muslim world. I found the Cordoba initiative as a multi faith and multinational initiative. Because it became very clear and very apparent that if we were going to do this we have to have Muslims and non-Muslims in this country and internationally cooperating together in addressing the fundamental causes that have caused this and are continuously fuelling this.,INTERVIEWER, But the controversial itself,INTERVIEWEE, So the Cordoba house ,INTERVIEWER, though right isn't that causing to some degree an instability and a risk a risk of safety? I mean there's an address now that has become the flash point for a lot of anger. Isn't that a risk to Muslims and Americans?,INTERVIEWEE, There is a certain anger here no doubt. But if you don't do this right anger will explode in the Muslim world. If this is not handled correctly this crisis could become much bigger than the Danish cartoon crisis which resulted in attacks on Danish embassies in various parts of the Muslim world. And we have a much larger footprint in the Muslim world. If we don't handle this crisis correctly it could become something which could really become very very very dangerous indeed.,INTERVIEWER, Do you ask yourself how did you miss that? I mean it's been your life's mission and you and I have spoken in the past years to build bridges and reach out. And yet given what you know now would you have built?,INTERVIEWEE, As I mentioned it this story is not new. People knew about it.,INTERVIEWER, Right but given what you know now would you have said listen let's not do it there? Because it sounds like you're saying in retrospect wouldn't have done it.,INTERVIEWEE, Well yes.,INTERVIEWER, You would not have done it?, INTERVIEWEE, If I knew this would happen this would cause this kind of pain I wouldn't have done it. My life has been devoted to peacemaking. There are so many people who say so if you're saying it was a mistake then why can't you get out of it and not do it? Because we have to now make sure that whatever we do actually results in greater peace not in greater conflict.,INTERVIEWER, Many of the things that you've said over the last couple of years have been parsed as you well know. I'm sure you've read yourself over and over again in over the years. When we come back in the next break we're going to talk about some of the things you've said. A "60 Minutes" interview with Ed Bradley. We'll talk a little bit about Hamas and your position on Hamas as well right after the short break.,INTERVIEWEE, By all means.,INTERVIEWER, We're back talking to Imam Feisal. Thank you for being with us. There are two mosques already in that region of Ground Zero. Yours as you pointed out is about 12 blocks away from the actual Ground Zero what people call the hole in the ground. I live downtown. I've seen it a lot. Then another one that's just about two blocks away. Why do you think this structure's causing all this controversy now?,INTERVIEWEE, Well there's a certain amount of anti-Islamic sentiment in this country.,INTERVIEWER, Why now?,INTERVIEWEE, And we have seen it in the attacks upon mosques in various parts of the country in the last several weeks. So it is clear that this issue is not just about our center which is an attempt to create peace between Muslims and non-Muslims. This has aroused a certain anti-Islam sentiment which is unfortunate in this country. But we need to look at it. We need to have a discourse about it. We need to make sure this doesn't dominate the discourse between us because Americans believe fundamentally and in a very fundamental and strong way about freedom of religion about separation of governments and churches separation of church and state which means that the powers of the government should not be used to coerce people to believe in any one religion. But it should be used to defend and protect religious rights and freedoms. So this is the conversation we need to have right now.,INTERVIEWER, About two weeks after 9/11 you were interviewed by Ed Bradley on "60 Minutes." I want to play a little chunk of how that interview went. There you have said when people run that various snippet that that is taken out of context. What's the context?,INTERVIEWEE, Well I was describing the fact that United States had actually worked with the Taliban cooperated with the Mujahadin. The Mujahadin were VIPs in the Reagan White House administration. And Osama bin Laden was something that wethe United States cooperated with in fighting the Soviet Union. However looking back at it right now I realize it was not a very compassionate thing to say and I regret having used those words.,INTERVIEWER, But do you believe that U.S. policies led to the World Trade Center being hit by planes by terrorists?,INTERVIEWEE, Um I ,INTERVIEWER, You know there'smaybe shouldn'tyou feel it wasn't necessary a politic thing to say but do you think it's true?,INTERVIEWEE, Well I mean Osama bin Laden was something you know we had worked with before and we seen what bin Laden did. And the sentiment certainly was bin Laden has shifted and we see what has happened and we have to understand what has happened in order to solve it. But wewethe work that we have to do now is not about pointing fingers.,INTERVIEWER, People always say that to me I don't want to point fingers when they don't want to necessarily answer the question which is do you think the U.S. was responsible for those attacks on its own soil by terrorists?,INTERVIEWEE, I was also trying to sayto share part of my role in bridge building Soledad is like what I do when marital couple comes to me you know when they've had some discord for counseling. And part of what I have to do is to speak the truth to each side or to tell them when you say this your husband hears that. When you sir when you say this your wife hears that. It is part of my responsibility as a bridge builder to speak the truth about what's great about America what we've done right and what our less glorious moments. And many people feel that the Iraq adventure for example has been one of our less glorious moments. But unless we're able to look and speak truthfully and understand the issues then the conversation is going to devolve into a situation where we're not going to be able to work and build bridges towards peace. The bigger conversation and the more important one is how do we build peace? It's not that easy.,INTERVIEWER, But doesn't that bring us back around to the same thing? Is it how to build peace to put a cultural center Islamic cultural center that will have a mosque that is angering so many people that 71 percent of the country says is not the right thing to do? Is that the right step to peace?,INTERVIEWEE, First we always said there's going to be a dedicated prayer space for Muslim which we do need. And we want to have prayer space for Christians and for Jews. As I said we have to build on our common platform. We need to buildwe need to make a space which creates and emphasizes a culture of worship. I as a Muslim want you as a Christian to really be a perfect Christian. I want my Jewish friends to be perfect Jews to live according to the highest principles of what it means to be a Jew to be a Christian to be a Muslim.,INTERVIEWER, We're back with Imam Feisal. Nice to have you.,INTERVIEWEE, Thank you.,INTERVIEWER, Let's talk about money. A hundred million dollars is the price tag for this Islamic cultural center. Where are you going to get the money?,INTERVIEWEE, Well we have yet to raise the capital campaign.,INTERVIEWER, You have no money for it yet.,INTERVIEWEE, We have not raised any money for it yet.,INTERVIEWER, Where will you get the money?,INTERVIEWEE, We will raise from whatever source we can domestically especially. And we're very transparent on how we've raised the money. This has been something that we've committed ourselves to.,INTERVIEWER, Meaning you will list whoever is giving you money.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, Will you turn down money from people who say give money to Hamas?,INTERVIEWEE, Absolutely.,INTERVIEWER, No question about it? Anyone who supports Hamas cannot give money to you?,INTERVIEWEE, We will do whatever is absolutely correct and legal and the safe thing to do.,INTERVIEWER, Which means what exactly? I mean because that'sthat's an extra condition.,INTERVIEWEE, You see I'm the visionary behind it. I'm not the actual builder. I'm not the financial expert. I'm not the legal expert on these things. But I have a vision here of establishing something which I know in my heart of hearts will be a powerful instrument of peace.,INTERVIEWER, Who would you not take money from? Who would you say no take it back? Who would you turn it away from me?,INTERVIEWEE, We would turn away from anybody who is deemed to be a danger to this process.,INTERVIEWER, There have been a lot of questions and I think a fair amount of controversy and criticism about questions that people have had about your take on Hamas. You were asked in an interview in the radio; the interviewer said is the State Department correct in designating Hamas as a terror group? And you dodged the question. You went on a long time. But there was really sort of no answer to it. Soand I guess people sense that whatever that answer is if youif you don't condemn Hamas then in a way maybe you're supporting Hamas as a terror organization. So I guess I'd ask that question again. Do youyou know is the State Department right in saying that Hamas is a terrorist organization?,INTERVIEWEE, I condemn everyone and anyone who commits acts of terrorism. And Hamas has committed acts of terrorism.,INTERVIEWER, Let's talk about Islam. I want to play you a chunk of what Franklin Graham a leading Christian has said about your religion. Their goal is world domination. And for the Muslim peace means when all the other nations are subject to Islam. Then we are at peace. The world will be at peace when the entire world is under Islam. Well I don't agree with the teachings of Islam. How do you respond to that?,INTERVIEWEE, Islam does not preach that at all. And the Koran is quite specific. Koran says whoever believes in God in the last day shall be saved. It is a religion whose very name Islam comes from the word Shalom which means peace. It's about establishing peace. We greet each other with peace be upon you which the Jews do in greeting each other. It's a religion based upon peace. But have there been people who haveyou know Muslims who have expressed such sentiments? Yes they have.,INTERVIEWER, The 9/11 hijackers said they were acting in the name of Islam.,INTERVIEWEE, That is a travesty. That is a travesty. Just as the inquisitors you know in Spain were committing a travesty against the teachings of Jesus Christ. We do have people in our faith community who have committed travesties against the teachings of Islam. This is part of theof theof the war or the battle within Islam today.,INTERVIEWER, Had moderate ,INTERVIEWEE,which has to be waged and which is being waged.,INTERVIEWER, Have moderate Muslims been vocal enough against extremists?,INTERVIEWEE, In the Muslim world there are many people who have been vocal and we have been very vocal against extremists. But how to win this battle is an on-going battle. And we must continue to wage the battle for peace.,INTERVIEWER, What is the likelihood do you think of another 9/11- type attack here?,INTERVIEWEE, I hate to think of that. I hate to think of that.,INTERVIEWER, But you said security national security is obviously of great concern to you.,INTERVIEWEE, It is fundamental importance to us. I mean look at what 9/11 did to our country. It traumatized the country. It has created a situation where Muslims are under even greater suspicion. It is important for us toto change that discourse to change that perception. And how do we change this perception Soledad if we don't engage if we don't dialogue if we don't get to know each other?,INTERVIEWER, Engaging and dialogue and getting to know each other. Right now it's kind of a screaming match in front of a store front.,INTERVIEWEE, Because the radicals on both have taken over the discourse.,INTERVIEWER, But do you thinkagain when you look atwhen you ask your average American 71 percent say they think it's a bad idea. The wisdom is not there in doing this. So are those people radicals?,INTERVIEWEE, No.,INTERVIEWER, Are they Islamophobic?,INTERVIEWEE, No it's because people are concerned. People want this problem to go away. I have been in this neighborhood for 25 years. I'll continue to be in this neighborhood after this thing dies down. Mayor Bloomberg was quoted as saying that he believes that the day after election day this story will go away.,INTERVIEWER, Do you think that's true?,INTERVIEWEE, That's what he said.,INTERVIEWER, Do you think that's true?,INTERVIEWEE, I hope it's true. I hope it dies down tomorrow because we need thisthis dangerous discourse to die down. We need to build bridges to build relationships to build friendships and to build a new chapter in Muslim/non-Muslim relations.,INTERVIEWER, Is this the right way to do that?,INTERVIEWEE, How do you propose we do it? How do you pose we really engage? You know Soledad we mustlook this is a matter of engagement right now. How do wehow do we continue engagement is the question.,INTERVIEWER, But engagement where people are furious peoplemany people on both sides of the issue are furious. Is that the kind of engagement ,INTERVIEWEE, I ask what is the solution? What is the solution to create an advancement of peace? We have to advance a discourse on peace. Our politicians get it.,INTERVIEWER, Isn't that the opposite of peace? Two sides yelling at each other with placards two blocks from Ground Zero which people I think here in New York and around the country would say that is sacred land. That isthat's a special place for everyone in America. Is thatis that a step toward peace there?,INTERVIEWEE, Well as Clyde Haberman (ph) and many people have said look at what exists in that neighborhood. Look at what exists around the corner.,INTERVIEWER, Oh Ibelieve me I live downtown so I know the neighborhood very well. ,INTERVIEWEE, So let's be clear. Calling this particular block sacred ground and what exists there. There's you know ,INTERVIEWER, Strip clubs and delis. I've been there a million times. But I think when people call it sacred ground they're saying something terrible happened on this spot and we can't ,INTERVIEWEE, We've got to be fair. You can't say a place that has strip joints is sacred ground. We've got to be just. We've got to speak the truth. We've got to have justice for everybody. We're a country of justice for all not justice for non-Muslims only or some groups and not for others. This is what America's all about Soledad. We've got to really mean what we say and say what our values are truly about. This isn'tthe discourse has been hijacked by people who say no.,INTERVIEWER, But in that 71 percent of people those are not extremists.,INTERVIEWEE, I recognize that. This is why I'm on the show with you today. I want to talk to these people show them my face show them what I'm about show them my track record. I have been looked at every which way. Every statement has been looked at including that is from 30 years ago when I was a young man. I've committed myself to this. Let me tell you my story.,INTERVIEWER, I'm going to have you tell me your story but after the commercial break.,INTERVIEWEE, It's very important to this particular issue.,INTERVIEWER, We'll talk about your work with the State Department as well. We're going to take a break and we'll come back in just a moment. Let's talk a little bit about your past. You've been working for the State Department or with the State Department for many years under the Bush administration and now as well. What exactly do you do?,INTERVIEWEE, Well the State Department has a visitor's program exchange program where they send people from this country Americans all over the world to talk about things in Latin America and various other subjects. And they also invite people from other parts of the world to visit the United States get to know the United States.,INTERVIEWER, That's a national security mission in a way?,INTERVIEWEE, It's kind of an exchange visitors' program to getto build relationships between people in various professions religions et cetera with their counterparts with other people in other parts of the world. I've done about half a dozen of these to various parts of the Muslim world.,INTERVIEWER, You've heard about this pastor in Florida Terry Jones who is proposing burning Korans on 9/11. What do you think of that?,INTERVIEWEE, I would plead with him to seriously what he is doing.,INTERVIEWER, Why?,INTERVIEWEE, It's going to feed into the radicals of the Muslim world. It's dangerous. General Petraeus has said that. It is something that is not the right thing to do on that ground.,INTERVIEWER, Do you think he has a right to do it?,INTERVIEWEE, And more importantlyand more importantlywell we have freedom in this country freedom of speech. But with freedom comes responsibility. And a famous saying to shot fire in a crowded theater. This is dangerous for our national security but also it's the un-Christian thing to do. Jesus Christ didn't teach us to do that. We Muslims have awe look to the example of our prophet. Many Christians say what would Jesus do? Jesus taught us to turn the other cheek. Jesus taught us to love your enemy. We are not your enemies. But this is what Jesus taught us to do. And I would like to suggest that you know we all have to live by the highest principles of our faith traditions. As I mentioned it's importantI want Christians to liveto be perfected Christians and I want Muslims to be perfected Muslims and Jews to be perfected Jews. If we don't do that if we judge each other by the worst of the other's behavior and by the best of our own where are we going?,INTERVIEWER, We have time for one last question with Imam Feisal. Can you unequivocally say we're going to build this Islamic Center/Mosque at this location two blocks from Ground Zero?,INTERVIEWEE, We certainly hope to build the Cordoba House vision of a multi-faith center that will build relationships between Muslims and non-Muslims.,INTERVIEWER, There?,INTERVIEWEE, On this night my Jewish friends are celebrating Rosh Hashanah and I wish to wish them a happy Rosh Hashanah including Larry King on whose show we are on tonight and to wish them well. And in this peace in this team we need to build peace. Peace is the name of our religion. Peace is how Muslims and Jews create each other. And Jesus Christ said blessed are the peace makers for they shall be called the children of God. INTERVIEWER, That opens tomorrow. "For Colored Girls." How did this move come about for you?,INTERVIEWEE, Let me so. I heard that giggle that you just did.,INTERVIEWER, You like my giggle? It's kind of a turn on huh?,INTERVIEWEE, You got a lot of nerve. How did this come about for me?,INTERVIEWER, Yes.,INTERVIEWEE, When I was shooting "Why Did I Get Married 2" we were at the tail end of shooting it and there was a production of "For Colored Girls" in Atlanta and Tyler wanted me to see the play with him. We went to the play and I really enjoyed it and he said you know they want me -- they've asked me to direct and write this for the big screen. I said oh that's awesome are you going to do it? And he said I'm thinking about it. He said so -- I brought you because I am thinking of -- I would like for you to be a part of this. I said oh this is why we came. He goes why else did you think I brought you to see this play with me? I said I thought oh two friends hanging out having a good time. So that's how it actually came about.,INTERVIEWER, He's a great guy by the way.,INTERVIEWEE, He's wonderful.,INTERVIEWER, Fun to work with.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, By the way Janet Jackson has a hit album out called "The Best Of." You can get that anywhere. You play Jo. Tell me about her?,INTERVIEWEE, Jo. Joanna Bradmore. She runs her all fashion mag. She's very very -- a very successful woman. She comes from the ghetto with the rest of the girls. Reside -- she has worked really hard to make her way out of that. She's very shrewd.,INTERVIEWER, She's the most successful of the group?,INTERVIEWEE, She's -- yes she is the successful one and will do anything to stay away from that life. She wants no part of it whatsoever. She's really shrewd bold. Her color is red. She's very fierce. She has no room for niceties. She's a kind of a bitch.,INTERVIEWER, Do you like her or not like her?,INTERVIEWEE, I like her very much.,INTERVIEWER, Is this a comedy?,INTERVIEWEE, No.,INTERVIEWER, Not at all?,INTERVIEWEE, It's -- everyone's been talking about how intense it is.,INTERVIEWER, When you saw the play.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, Did you think of yourself as Jo?,INTERVIEWEE, No I was just enjoying watching these women in this play who did an incredible job. And Jasmine Guy who actually had directed the play the production that I saw. No I didn't at all. I didn't see my --,INTERVIEWER, So when he said he wanted you for it did you think Jo would be the part?,INTERVIEWEE, Well I didn't know what he -- what part he wanted me to play. So when he actually called me up and said that the script is coming along and told me a little bit about my character I thought this is really interesting. This is really different from anything that I have ever done. And I thought well this is going to be a challenge. And when I actually read the script I thought wow this is really cool. So I was up for the challenge.,INTERVIEWER, What was it like doing it?,INTERVIEWEE, I loved it. It was -- it was intense. It was very very very intense on a daily basis. Like I said she's no BS she has no room for niceties. So every single day of shooting was tough. It was really tough and especially what she's going through with her husband her home life and as well as her relationship with herself.,INTERVIEWER, It's interesting because you were born Janet Demeta Jo Jackson. Right? So now you're Jo again?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes. Actually her original name in the script Tyler called her Carmen. And I wanted to change her name to Jo. I thought Carmen was a little too sweet and her full name Joanna which is softer but just to call her Jo that toughness that little toughness.,INTERVIEWER, When you said you're red in this what do you mean you're red? ,INTERVIEWEE, Each woman has a color. "For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide When the Rainbow Is Enuf." Each woman has a color that represents their personality their character. My color happens to be red which you know gives a little bit of insight of -- to who I am what I'm like. There's another woman Loretta Devine she's -- her color is green. Anika Noni Rose. All the women are wonderful. Absolutely wonderful in this film. She's yellow. So every woman has their color that represents to a certain degree who they are.,INTERVIEWER, What's Tyler Perry like to work for? He's a great guest.,INTERVIEWEE, You've had him on your show yes.,INTERVIEWER, Yes.,INTERVIEWEE, He's wonderful. I enjoy working with Tyler. It's -- there's a sense of family that togetherness that bond that closeness which I love coming from a big family. His sets are always fun always very enjoyable. Even though with this it was a little different because it was so intense on a daily basis. But still I enjoyed being there every single day coming to work.,INTERVIEWER, How do you think it will do commercially?,INTERVIEWEE, Well I hope. And --,INTERVIEWER, But it's getting great word about it.,INTERVIEWEE, I -- yes. It is -- it's getting a great word of mouth. And I hope it does well. I think it will do well. I think this movie is not just for colored -- women of color it's for all women. All walks of life. I think you will find as a woman a part of yourself or someone you used to be or someone you know in one of these women. There's a couple of women that I see the old me in.,INTERVIEWER, How about men will men like it?,INTERVIEWEE, I think they will for sure. I think there's a lot for them to learn. It's not just about women it's about their relationships. Whether it's their husbands boyfriends men that they're --,INTERVIEWER, Semi-involved with.,INTERVIEWEE, Exactly. There's a lot. It's really a great story in the way Tyler has infused his words with Ntozake Shange the poet with her work because this was an award winning Broadway play back in the '70s.,INTERVIEWER, Heavy.,INTERVIEWEE, It's a really intense film. And Omari Hardwick plays my husband. He's wonderful in this film.,INTERVIEWER, Kerry Washington is in it. Phylicia Rashad is in it. Our friend Whoopi Goldberg. Thandie Newton. But you said you didn't interact with them a lot. Off the set.,INTERVIEWEE, It's great.,INTERVIEWER, Why not?,INTERVIEWEE, Staying in character. Wanting to --,INTERVIEWER, You do? You did that?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes. Really wanting to stay in character during the duration every moment even when he said cut of filming. And like I said she wants nothing to do with the ghetto.,INTERVIEWER, With the rift-raft.,INTERVIEWEE, And her past life. She worked too hard to get out of that. And keeping these walls up. So I would hear the girls in there cackling and talking and part of me wanted to be a part of that. But to remain true to the character I stayed away.,INTERVIEWER, So when you stay in character -- many great actors have told me they do that -- did you also bring it home?,INTERVIEWEE, There are times when you do. You don't just walk away from it. There were times when my friends would say there's something different about you the tone in your voice. And Tyler actually wanted to play it with my tone imposed and make it a little lower tone. And I told him let me try it let me try it first on my own and see what happens. And so he liked what I did so he just left it at that.,INTERVIEWER, You like acting?,INTERVIEWEE, I love it.,INTERVIEWER, Why?,INTERVIEWEE, This is my first passion. This is my --,INTERVIEWER, More than singing?,INTERVIEWEE, This is what I signed up to do when I was a kid. This is my first job. When I was 10 years old. Singing was my second job.,INTERVIEWER, And dancing as you know was third. You know we were a great couple.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes. Yes. We have got our moves.,INTERVIEWER, But acting is first?,INTERVIEWEE, Well this is what I did. This is what I originally did. And this is what I just knew for sure I wanted to grow up and go to school study business law study acting and become an actress.,INTERVIEWER, So what veered off? How did the singing come?,INTERVIEWEE, My father.,INTERVIEWER, Yes?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes. And it's you know the family business. He told me that he wanted me to sing.,INTERVIEWER, So he said it and you had to do it?,INTERVIEWEE, Kind of. For the most part yes. And it's been -- I'm not complaining it's been wonderful for me and I really enjoyed. I love performing. And --,INTERVIEWER, You still sing?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes. And it's in my blood but this is -- I'm finally getting around to doing something that I've wanted to do since I was a kid making films.,INTERVIEWER, So you want to do more of this?,INTERVIEWEE, Of course I'm going to.,INTERVIEWER, Would you like to do a play?, INTERVIEWEE, I would love to do that. That's always -- that's been another dream of mine to do a Broadway play. An award winning Broadway play.,INTERVIEWER, Are you still touring?,INTERVIEWEE, At the moment no. I may do a little private thing here a little private thing there but as of going on a tour no.,INTERVIEWER, What about with your brothers?,INTERVIEWEE, No.,INTERVIEWER, Your sister?,INTERVIEWEE, No.,INTERVIEWER, So Janet goes it her own way? Can I say that?,INTERVIEWEE, I guess so.,INTERVIEWER, All right in a recent "Jet" magazine article you said that in the past you have not had a lot of friends. Is that a correct quote?,INTERVIEWEE, I don't have a lot of friends.,INTERVIEWER, Why?,INTERVIEWEE, It's not easy in this industry. And I'm glad I don't have a lot of friends.,INTERVIEWER, Is it a trust issue?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes. It's very much a trust issue. I'm happy with the people that I have around me. And they've been friends of mine since I was young for a very long time.,INTERVIEWER, So new people don't come into Janet Jackson's life easily?,INTERVIEWEE, Not really. It's definitely a trust issue for myself.,INTERVIEWER, We're back with Janet Jackson. "For Colors Girls" opens as they say wide tomorrow. Major Broadway hit. Could be a major vehicle as a film as well. With all your talents your achievements your celebrity the fact that it's hard for you to make few friends do you think you intimidate people?,INTERVIEWEE, You know there's a line in the song "All For You" that talks about intimidation. And when I was at the time dating guys really not -- wanting to approach me but not approaching me and me inviting them to approach me. But it's that intimidation that will always get in the way. And I've been told that.,INTERVIEWER, Do you date now?,INTERVIEWEE, I'm actually seeing someone.,INTERVIEWER, Can you tell us about it?,INTERVIEWEE, No.,INTERVIEWER, No?,INTERVIEWEE, He's a very private man. So I respect --,INTERVIEWER, We respect that too. Only -- I only will ask is he in the business?,INTERVIEWEE, No.,INTERVIEWER, Does that make it easier? The fact that he's not?,INTERVIEWEE, Easier?,INTERVIEWER, Well by the fact that you're not clashing --,INTERVIEWEE, I am enjoying the fact that he's not in the business. But I don't know if it makes things easier.,INTERVIEWER, OK. Going back to music some of your fans -- and we've covered this -- has asked me today in fact have you abandoned music?,INTERVIEWEE, No. Not at all.,INTERVIEWER, So straighten this out. You will sing?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes. Just because I've made two films back to back it's seems like I said before it's always been a dream of mine to do something like this so I kind of put music on the back burner to do this. And I will continue to do more films. But definitely I can't give up music it's in my blood. And I love love love performing. So I will make more music. I think I have thought to go into the studio and just take my time fool around next year.,INTERVIEWER, How about a musical film?,INTERVIEWEE, I would love to do that.,INTERVIEWER, Combine both.,INTERVIEWEE, I would love to do that. There's a lot of things that I want to do and that I'm going to do.,INTERVIEWER, All right. I bet when you saw "Dream Girls" you would have thought I could have played in that.,INTERVIEWEE, I enjoyed that a great deal. I did see that. Never saw it on Broadway. But yes I saw the film.,INTERVIEWER, OK. You've written a book. Called "True You." It's due out in January.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, The title explain that.,INTERVIEWEE, "True You." People have asked me about the weight loss the weight gain the workout regimen the nutrition and instead of writing just about that I wanted to take it to the very beginning of what may have brought all of that on. So that took me back to my childhood and I had self esteem issues. And it's not an auto biography but there are anecdotes little anecdotes throughout my life beginning from my childhood up until now and it allows you to see what may have caused telling my little stories. You know my dream is to really not appeal to adults but to appeal to children as well as teens and hopefully they will relate to one of my stories or I have stories as well of fans that have written to me. So I have put some of those stories in. And hopefully they can relate to one of those stories and it'll be able to help them in some way.,INTERVIEWER, It's designed as a kind of help people book?,INTERVIEWEE, It's a self-help book so it's about being who you are and learning to love yourself as you are. 'The True You.",INTERVIEWER, You had an early weight problem?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes I did. It was a body image issue. I was so self- conscious at a very --,INTERVIEWER, So when you look to the mirror you didn't like yourself?,INTERVIEWEE, And I was told certain things that I'm too this I'm too that. I should be more like this more like that. At a very very young age. When I did "Good Times" I was just 10 years old. And they never discussed with me ahead of time. But I remember my first episode. One of the wardrobe women she bound my chest because I was developing at a very young age and they thought you know I was a guess a little too big for my age. So that immediately translated to me that I wasn't good enough. The way that I was. So it was little things like that that really affect a child.,INTERVIEWER, Did you have it all through your teenaged years?,INTERVIEWEE, For sure. For sure. I did until -- you know I was the kind of person that internalized everything. I held everything in. And it wasn't until I opened up and spoke to someone who I really felt that I could communicate with who would not judge me who I could truly trust that my life began to change and that was much later on in my life.,INTERVIEWER, Was a doctor?,INTERVIEWEE, No. He -- I -- he wants to remain anonymous. But I've spoken about him before. He's -- I call him a cowboy. He is actually a cowboy.,INTERVIEWER, Still in your life?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes. We still talk.,INTERVIEWER, Janet Jackson what a performer. What a star. Her new movie "For Colored Girls" opens tomorrow all across the United States. Her book will be out in January. Lots of things happening as always in her life. There's always something happening in Janet Jackson's life. How do you feel about your body now by the way when you look in the mirror? Are you happy with Janet?,INTERVIEWEE, I'm the happiest I've actually ever been in my life at this very moment. And I still have my days. I'm a work in progress. I still have my days where -- they're not the greatest and I have my moments of -- where I feel really really good. So it's still a work in progress for me.,INTERVIEWER, You don't feel overweight though do you?,INTERVIEWEE, No I don't but I can definitely tighten things up for sure.,INTERVIEWER, You described your new short hairstyle as liberating. I like it but why is it liberating?,INTERVIEWEE, It was just like shedding all the old skin. It's not the first time I have cut all of my hair off. I have done it several times before. But it's the first time that I've done it since the whole Internet craze so everyone made a big to-do really about me cutting my hair. But it was liberating. It was freeing. And it's easy.,INTERVIEWER, You did it yourself? No one said do it?,INTERVIEWEE, Did somebody tell you to do it? No I've been wanting to do it for a while. I always get bored with my hair. That's why I would always change it throughout my career. And I guess people thought it's just for this project that I've had. It was really me being bored. When I was a kid I would get bored with my hair and I'd walk around with pink hair one moment then blue hair another moment.,INTERVIEWER, You are an interesting person.,INTERVIEWEE, Just being a kid.,INTERVIEWER, Would you say of all the Jacksons you're the most complicated?,INTERVIEWEE, The most rebellious. Myself and my brother Randy. The babies of the family.,INTERVIEWER, The two babies?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, Are the most rebellious?,INTERVIEWEE, I would say so.,INTERVIEWER, Does the family accept this? Your dad and your mom? They all accept this? The brothers?,INTERVIEWEE, They're so tired.,INTERVIEWER, What?,INTERVIEWEE, To the point -- you have nine kids by the time the babies come around it's like go ahead.,INTERVIEWER, Is it true you were very honest in the book?, INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, Was that hard sometimes to write?,INTERVIEWEE, There were a lot of things that I actually had dealt with already and I thought OK.,INTERVIEWER, It's catharsis.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, Do you keep a diary?,INTERVIEWEE, No.,INTERVIEWER, Personal journal no?,INTERVIEWEE, No my albums have been my diaries.,INTERVIEWER, We know that in the world of show business sometimes too much too soon has a long lasting affect. And a lot of kid stars are never heard from again. How do you think you avoided that? Because you got a lot of attention as a kid. It's got to play something with your head.,INTERVIEWEE, I was really really fortunate. I think it has a lot to do with who you surround yourself with your upbringing how grounded your parents make sure you continue to be or are from day one and continuing that all the way up into your adult hood. And that goes a long way. And your faith in God having that as a foundation as well I think all of that is the reason why I didn't get into any drama. And I'm thankful. I'm very fortunate.,INTERVIEWER, Were you ever tempted?,INTERVIEWEE, No.,INTERVIEWER, Never did? Never got into that scene?,INTERVIEWEE, No.,INTERVIEWER, All right tell me about the It Gets Better campaign which I understand supporting gay youth.,INTERVIEWEE, The Trevor Project.,INTERVIEWER, What got you involved?,INTERVIEWEE, You know I first heard about the Trevor Project years ago from a makeup artist who became a wonderful friend of mine. He's no longer around me. Rest in peace Kevin Quant (ph). And he supported them. And he would always talk to me about this organization. I wanted to get involved. Being one of those kids who could truly relate holding everything inside like I was telling you internalizing everything. And that really can affect you and feeling helpless and hopeless and finding that person that you can trust that adult like I did later on in life that I felt comfortable and safe to tell my issues my worries my pains my aches to. This is what the Trevor Project is really all about. And they have a 24-hour hotline.,INTERVIEWER, It's for bullying right?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes. For the -- definitely especially with what's been going on just recently what has happened. It's sad. They have a 24- hour hotline. The number is 866-For-You-Trevor. And they have a website TheTrevorProject.org. And there's someone there that you can speak with 24 hours that will be there for you.,INTERVIEWER, We did a whole program about bullying about the Trevor Project. I know you have studied it. You've looked into it. Were you ever bullied?,INTERVIEWEE, No.,INTERVIEWER, Do you understand why people bully? ,INTERVIEWEE, I think it really says more about themselves how they feel about themselves. There's something about themselves I feel that doesn't set right something -- whether they hate they dislike something that may be going on issues at home with their parents. Who knows what it is? But it's something going on inside of them. And I think it's them lashing out.,INTERVIEWER, One can only -- it must be terrible to have a -- to be gay and hold it in be afraid.,INTERVIEWEE, Not be able to be true you.,INTERVIEWER, Yeah.,INTERVIEWEE, No really. To be proud of who you are. Everyone should be. You should never hide your true self.,INTERVIEWER, But it comes from teaching doesn't it? We're taught to hate.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes we're not born that way. And that's so unfortunate that adults teach us to hate. It's sad.,INTERVIEWER, That's the Trevor Project right?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes the Trevor Project.,INTERVIEWER, Give me the number again.,INTERVIEWEE, It's 866-For-You-Trevor. A 24-hour hotline there will always be someone for you to talk to.,INTERVIEWER, You're being bullied --,INTERVIEWEE, Yes someone to just open up and tell just everything you can pour out to.,INTERVIEWER, By the way if you're a bully or if you have those tendencies you can call too?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes of course.,INTERVIEWER, They'll try to help you in every way.,INTERVIEWEE, Of course.,INTERVIEWER, You have a greatest hits CD out called "Janet Jackson Number One Icon." How do you feel about that title? It's a little self- crediting isn't it? Did you title that album?,INTERVIEWEE, No I didn't title it. No I didn't title that. There was one before this that was just called "Janet Jackson Number Ones" and it had 33 of -- all 33 number ones and the new single a bonus track that wound up becoming a number one. So it was 34 in all.,INTERVIEWER, You have had 34 number ones?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, Thirty four number ones?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, There's talk that could be Oscar?,INTERVIEWEE, It would be nice.,INTERVIEWER, Would you sing it on the Awards show?,INTERVIEWEE, I don't think they do that anymore.,INTERVIEWER, No they don't. That's right. They don't do the songs. You wrote that song.,INTERVIEWEE, I wrote that with Jermaine Dupri yes.,INTERVIEWER, When -- does writing come easily to you?,INTERVIEWEE, For the most part yes. It's so funny because I remember when I was a kid -- I started writing when I was nine years old. I wrote my very first song when I was nine.,INTERVIEWER, What was the song?,INTERVIEWEE, "Fantasy" is the title. I remember being a kid and my brother Randy my brother Mike and myself we have our chores to do after dinner especially I remember one night in particular I was doing dishes I think Mike was sweeping the floor. And Randy was cleaning off the tables and all the counter tops. And that's how we would always create music. We could come up with melodies and then we would add lyrics to them. And we would sing a three part harmony. We were very young. But it's good practice.,INTERVIEWER, Where did this new song come from?,INTERVIEWEE, "Nothing?",INTERVIEWER, Yes.,INTERVIEWEE, From the movie. I had ask Tyler if he had a theme song for the movie and he said no. I told him I would love to give it a go if he wouldn't mind. I viewed the movie twice with Jermaine. And then Jermaine and I just went into his studio and we created this and presented it to Tyler. I didn't know if he would like it or not. I was hoping he would. And he loved it. So it was really from the characters in the film.,INTERVIEWER, It fits the film?,INTERVIEWEE, Perfectly.,INTERVIEWER, Because sometimes you'll see songs that don't even pay attention to the film.,INTERVIEWEE, No this was written for the film and watching those characters.,INTERVIEWER, We're not going to dwell on this because it is too much a part of a sad past. But you said you that you learned of Michael's death while you were filming in Atlanta for Tyler Perry's other movie "Why Did I Get Married II." You said focused on work and work helped you through grief. How?,INTERVIEWEE, Actually I -- they were already shooting. I hadn't started shooting just yet. But I was supposed to start in a few days. And I was at home in New York when I learned of my brother's passing.,INTERVIEWER, How did you learn?,INTERVIEWEE, I got a call and there was something on TV on CNN.,INTERVIEWER, You never get through that.,INTERVIEWEE, No.,INTERVIEWER, You said in a recent interview you spent a lot of time feeling lonely even when you have people around you all the time. Can you explain that? Lonely in a crowd?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes that is -- that was the worst for me. There's nothing worse than being lonely and having people around you especially people that you love people that you need to be involved with. It was very very sad for me. And I'm not going to say anything more about that Larry than that.,INTERVIEWER, No I don't want to -- you work hard though don't you? You're working like all the time?,INTERVIEWEE, I enjoy working. I love to work. I love to keep busy. Don't get me wrong I love my little down time too. I love being on an island and a get away or being with my family or being with that person that I spend my life with and just relaxing by an ocean by the beach. INTERVIEWER, Do you miss marriage? You were married once?,INTERVIEWEE, I was married twice.,INTERVIEWER, Twice. Do you miss it?,INTERVIEWEE, Are you getting around to something? Is there something you want to ask me?,INTERVIEWER, No.,INTERVIEWEE, You trying to propose. No I'm just joking.,INTERVIEWER, OK what's next? You said you would like to do a Broadway thing.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes I would for sure. And I'm eventually going to because like I said that's always been a dream of mine since I was a kid. When I'm that attached that passionate about something I don't let go of it. It might be a minute before I get to it. But I don't let go of it.,INTERVIEWER, I would imagine since many people in the Broadway business watch this show that would be intriguing to them too. Do you think you would like doing matinees and evenings and eight shows a week?,INTERVIEWEE, You know a friend of mine was on Broadway and he told me that. He said it's very --,INTERVIEWER, Wednesday matinee.,INTERVIEWEE, He said it's grueling. He said it's a whole other discipline. And that's what --,INTERVIEWER, Attracted you.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes that whole other discipline my brain went ding ding ding; what's that like? I want to experience that see what that's about. It just seems like it would be just so much fun to be able to perform on a daily basis. That's a whole other grind that I have never experienced but someday I will.,INTERVIEWER, Because when you do a movie it's stop and go right?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, What music do you listen to?,INTERVIEWEE, All kinds. My favorite is -- what I grew up on was jazz and Brazilian. That was my love.,INTERVIEWER, Bossa Nova?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes. Maria -- Maria Bethania Ky Televaloso (ph).,INTERVIEWER, Paula Shovey (ph)?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes Jiberta Gile (ph). Nasamento (ph),INTERVIEWER, Anthony Hepbare (ph).,INTERVIEWEE, Yes. You say -- you're --,INTERVIEWER, "The Girl from Ipanema"?,INTERVIEWEE, I love that Astrid.,INTERVIEWER, Stan Getz?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes. Joelle Jiberto (ph) I love her version -- or his version with Stan Getz. And she's on that --,INTERVIEWER, Yes.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, What do you think of Lady Gaga?,INTERVIEWEE, I love her.,INTERVIEWER, Because?,INTERVIEWEE, I enjoy her music. I feel that she came along and she introduced something a little bit different for the people of today. For myself it's -- and I don't mean this in a negative way at all. It -- it's a little reminiscent of Grace Jones how big how out there her costumes are how loud how strong. And I mean that in a very complimenting way.,INTERVIEWER, How good a singer is she?,INTERVIEWEE, I think she's very talented. She writes her own music. I think she has a wonderful voice. And I had the opportunity of meeting her for the first time. Was it last year? But I knew of her before she became the Lady Gaga that everyone --,INTERVIEWER, Where did you meet her?,INTERVIEWEE, I met her at a concert of hers. And her story I thought was incredible. And when I knew of this artist I was really pulling for her before she had gotten this recording contract.,INTERVIEWER, You were on the finale of "American Idol.",INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, Earlier this year with my dear friend Ryan Seacrest.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, What do you think of that show and the impact it's had on the industry?,INTERVIEWEE, It's so huge. ,INTERVIEWER, Amazing.,INTERVIEWEE, I think it's a wonderful outlet for finding fresh talent new talent. And it's fun to watch. Because I work like crazy I mean I watch here and there but I enjoy it. But I enjoy it. When I do watch I always enjoy it.,INTERVIEWER, I'm told -- I knew this lady great lady -- that you'd like to do a film "The Life of Eartha Kitt." There was no one like her.,INTERVIEWEE, I had the opportunity of getting to know her. Just before she passed we were getting to know one another. And I was fortunate enough to spend some time with her. And I saw her at Carnegie. And I was -- she had a performance in September of that year that I -- she wanted me to come and see her. And I wanted to. It just so happens that something came up and I had to work and I couldn't make it. And I -- I absolutely -- I still love her.,INTERVIEWER, She remains sexy late in life.,INTERVIEWEE, And how -- the way she performed that night when I saw her she blew me away. And all the different languages.,INTERVIEWER, Oh.,INTERVIEWEE, Was it like eight? All the languages just amazing. I love "Santa Baby.",INTERVIEWER, "Put the sable under the tree for me." You said you're proud you remained true to yourself. But the self also changes. Have you been true to every change?,INTERVIEWEE, I've tried to be. We evolve as life goes on and as we get older. And I've tried to keep that -- keep that truth within me always.,INTERVIEWER, Is it -- do you think there's something hard about being a Jackson?,INTERVIEWEE, It has its pros and its cons. And I think that's with anything with anyone.,INTERVIEWER, Yeah but it's a label too. Right?,INTERVIEWEE, It can make things easy. It can also make things difficult.,INTERVIEWER, You keep on keeping on girl.,INTERVIEWEE, But I'm very proud of who I am and my family --,INTERVIEWER, You ought to be.,INTERVIEWEE, -- and my last name. I wear it proudly.,INTERVIEWER, We only go back -- well almost 30 years. B.B. that's his nickname but I have to refer to him as Prime Minister Netanyahu because that's formality here. Benjamin Netanyahu the Israeli prime minister in New York a city he knows very well used to be ambassador to the U.N. Let's get right to it. It's good seeing you again by the way.,INTERVIEWEE, Good to see you Larry. You didn't have to reveal how far back we go together.,INTERVIEWER, That's right you got a point. A few months ago you went to the White House. It didn't go too well. What changed yesterday?,INTERVIEWEE, I think there's an underlying relationship there that people don't appreciate. We have our ups and downs. People focus on the downs and the downs are exaggerated and sometimes distorted. But there is ups and there's a basic bedrock of identification common values between Israel and the United States. The president gives it expression. I give it expression. And yesterday's meeting gave it expression. I think there is a solidity of ties between Israel and the United States that the president of the United States and the prime minister of Israel reflect in their meeting.,INTERVIEWER, No matter who holds the posts?,INTERVIEWEE, I think every prime minister every president has his own points his own viewpoints but there's a common position of friendship and a basic alliance that is there that really is continued by all leaders whoever they are. That was definitely the case yesterday.,INTERVIEWER, Mr. Prime Minister have there been times though since President Obama took office where you felt that friendship or that tie weakened?,INTERVIEWEE, No a lot of things that the public is not aware of that throughout the year and some that I've been in office we've had continuous cooperation in the fields of security in the fields of intelligence in the fields of vital strategic importance to Israel and the United States. And that seems to go unnoticed or unremarked. People always focus on differences of views that we may have. They're minor compared to the things that unite us. We have -- Israel is the only democracy in the Middle East. America's the world's greatest democracy. We have both common values and unfortunately common enemies. The people who attack the United States and the Middle East attack Israel. The people that we are fighting are the people you are fighting. So there's a great commonalty a great cooperation that goes underneath the surface. And sometimes I'm happy to say it does come to the surface. It did yesterday. It really should be an indication of something that guides our relationship throughout.,INTERVIEWER, So there's no time that you question President Obama's commitment to your country?,INTERVIEWEE, No. And I think there's no time that he questioned Israel's unwavering commitment as a firm American ally. I would say there is no greater ally no greater friend of the United States than Israel. And there is no greater friend and no greater ally of Israel than the United States.,INTERVIEWER, There were those who were saying though in the past few months until that meeting yesterday the relationships were at the lowest they have been in 35 years. Do you buy that?,INTERVIEWEE, Look no I don't. I think the support for Israel and the American people and the intertwining of interests and cooperation between our governments is increasing all the time. It's obscured by the bumps on the road. But there's no question that the road is going forward and going upwards I have no doubt about that.,INTERVIEWER, All right let's get into some things. Mr. Prime Minister you say that you want to have direct talks with the Palestinians. So when are you and President Abbas the Palestinian Authority going to sit down? When's it going to happen? It's so frustrating to the world -- ,INTERVIEWEE, That's a very -- that's an excellent question that I've been asking for a year and a quarter ever since I got into office. On day one that I got in I said President Abbas the Palestinian president meet me and let's talk peace. And I use this forum today on the "Larry King" show to say President Abbas meet me and let's talk peace. We all have our grievances. We all have our you know our questions and things that we want answered. But the most important thing is to get together sit down in a room and begin to negotiate peace. You cannot resolve a conflict you cannot successfully complete a peace negotiation if you don't start it.And I say let's start it right now today tomorrow in Jerusalem in Ramallah or anywhere else. I'm prepared to go to a warm city like New York or a cool city anywhere. Let's get on with the business of talking peace and concluding the peace agreement.,INTERVIEWER, So forgive me what's holding it up? He could watch this show. We did a show some years ago with Arafat with Yitzhak Rabin and King Hussein of Jordan a historic show. I was in Washington. The three of them were in their homelands. It was terrific. Why can't -- would you do that if we had you and Abbas and we had the king of Jordan on? Could we do that now?,INTERVIEWEE, You're on Larry. From my point of view immediately no problem.,INTERVIEWER, All right. So if we worked on that we could set it up? Because it's -- it's frustrating -- go ahead.,INTERVIEWEE, Well I'm just saying that you're hitting the nail right on the head. I mean what is there to prevent a meeting between the prime minister of Israel in Jerusalem and the president of the Palestinian Authority Mahmoud Abbas who's 10 minutes away in Ramallah that's when you have traffic. Without traffic it's seven minutes. I really like and respect Senator George Mitchell President Obama's envoy to the Middle East. But I find it perplexing and unnecessary that president -- that Senator Mitchell has to travel halfway across the world to relay messages between President Abbas and myself. There's no need for that. We should sit down. We have very serious issues to discuss. Our security the question of where the borders will end up the question of settlements the question of Palestinian refugees the question of water. All these things are crucially important. The only way that they're going to be resolved is if we actually sit down and negotiate a peace. I think leaders have to do exactly that. I think we have to break molds break stereotypes and cut right through to a solution. I'm prepared to do it. I'm prepared to lead. And I hope that President Abbas hears my call responds to it. I think we'll have important and steady help from President Obama. But there is no substitute for the two leaders. The leader of Israel and the leader of the Palestinian Authority to get down together talk peace and make peace.,INTERVIEWER, And we can kick it off on this show. We'll be right back with Benjamin Netanyahu the Israeli prime minister. Don't go away. We're back with Prime Minister Netanyahu. He is in New York. We're in Los Angeles. What about the settlements issue? President Obama said yesterday he expected talks to begin before the moratorium on settlement construction expires which is late September. Will you extend the moratorium by the way if things aren't settled by late September?,INTERVIEWEE, Larry the whole settlement issue was supposed to be discussed in the final peace -- what are called final status peace negotiations which means how to achieve a final peace. This is one of the issues we have to resolve. Seven months ago I did something quite extraordinary that is no other prime minister in Israel's history did this. I put on a temporary freeze of 10 months of new construction in the settlements in order to encourage the Palestinians to get into the peace talks. Seven months have passed by. They don't come in. They say oh we need now another extension. And the answer is right now listen we don't need any pretext and preconditions. Let's just get into the talks. And one of the things we'll discuss right away is issues of settlements. And that's what I propose doing. In any case what is important is to get down and talk. That's the important thing.,INTERVIEWER, President Clinton once said to me that the difficulties in the Middle East are harder to solve than Ireland/England. That it's so deep rooted and so frustrating. Can you explain to a waiting world why you can't get together?,INTERVIEWEE, I can and I'm offering to do exactly that. I think there's been a persistent refusal in many Arab quarters to recognize the state of Israel borders. I think the issue of borders is important. It's related to our security. But the issue of recognition the basic recognition of the Jewish state that exists in the Middle East that is the homeland of the Jewish people that lives in peace and security with its neighbors is something that is recognized by some. We made peace with Egypt. We made peace with Jordan. I think it's important to make peace with the Palestinians. And I'm prepared to negotiate that peace right away. I think it requires courage on the Palestinian side for all those who don't really want a peace with Israel to stand up and do what president -- the late president of Egypt Anwar Sadat did and to say hey it's over no more war no more bloodshed. We're going to make a genuine peace with Israel. I'm prepared to have a demilitarized Palestinian state live next to the Jewish state of Israel. I think the Palestinians should not be either subject of Israel or citizens of Israel. They should have their own independent country. And we should be assured that this country is not used as a staging ground for Iranian-sponsored terrorist attacks on us. And I think this combination of state for the Palestinians and security for Israel is something that can be brought about in direct negotiations that I propose to start without any preconditions without any pretext.,INTERVIEWER, Right.,INTERVIEWEE, Leaders don't need excuses. They just have to get on with it and I'm prepared to get on with it.,INTERVIEWER, Do you -- you absolutely favor a Palestinian state though right?,INTERVIEWEE, I do. And I want to make sure that it -- that we don't have a repeat of what happened in the other two times that we vacated territory. You know we left Lebanon every last square inch of it. And Iran came in and used it as a staging ground to launch 6000 rockets on Israel's cities 6000. We left Gaza last square inch and Iran used it to arm its proxies and fired another 6000 rockets. So we can't afford that happening a third time. Now when I say that Larry you can now reach one of two conclusions. Either don't make any peace attempt or ensure that the peace you do make has the necessary security arrangements on the ground to prevent this from happening a third time. That's what I propose to do. And I think it's possible to fashion a secure peace for Israel and a dignified peace and a dignified life for the Palestinians. I discussed this at some length yesterday with President Obama. And I'm very happy with the progress of those talks.,INTERVIEWER, All right. But Abbas isn't the only leader we have to concern ourselves with. Would you sit down with Hamas?,INTERVIEWEE, I'll sit down with anyone who will recognize my existence. Somebody who calls for our destruction my destruction is unfortunately not a partner for peace.,INTERVIEWER, So you would not sit down --,INTERVIEWEE, -- Hamas that calls -- well you know would you sit down with somebody who said we want to destroy the United States? Now come and talk to us?,INTERVIEWER, Do you think they can -- that can change at all? Do you think there's some way -- Secretary Mitchell Senator Mitchell maybe somewhat in between can get a little tempering of the language? I mean we're trying for the same result here. Nobody gets killed hopefully.,INTERVIEWEE, I think in the case of Hamas it's basically a proxy a terror proxy of Iran. Iran openly calls for our destruction. It denies the Holocaust. It sponsors terrorism everywhere. It brutalizes its own people. Hamas by the way does the same thing to the Palestinians in Gaza. They don't really have a choice. They can't really vote the Hamas out. They can't decide their own fate. But look at what is happening in the West Bank with our cooperation. You know we removed -- I removed hundreds of check points hundreds of road blocks. And the Palestinian economy on the West Bank is just booming. I mean there's coffee shops there's shopping malls there's e-businesses you name it. It's growing at about 8 percent or 9 percent a year which isn't bad these days. And I'm very happy for that. And I want to add on to that a formal peace -- peace with security and prosperity. Hamas is totally the other way around. They are -- you know they're subjecting their own people to terrible things. And they're using the territory to just stockpile weapons. I wish they -- I wish they'd change and I wish they'd accept the state of Israel. But as long as they call for our destruction there's not much we can do.,INTERVIEWER, We'll be right back with the prime minister of Israel after this. We're back with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of the state of Israel. Your coalition we know this has some right wingers who don't agree with the notion of a Palestinian state. You have some difficulties. There are always inner politics going on. Is there any way a pragmatic way to bring you and the Kadima together?,INTERVIEWEE, Well I've called for a national unity I've formed one. I've formed Likud labor alliance. And I'm always happy to broaden it to people who want to serve the nation. You know getting into the intricacies of Israeli politics would take a lot more of -- even a long program of "Larry King." It's a subject of encyclopedic advantage.,INTERVIEWER, Back to the difficulties. In May Israeli forces stormed a ship on a humanitarian mission to Gaza. Several Turkish activists were killed. I don't know if you've -- have you ever publicly said that you were wrong to do this?,INTERVIEWEE, Well we were definitely sorry about the loss of life. But I'll tell you what happened. First of all why do we check ships that go to Gaza? Because we are concerned with the flow of -- the possible flow of weaponry into Gaza. We've had as I said thousands of rockets fired on us. I think that what people fail to recognize is that there were six ships. Five of them were totally peaceful and nothing of substance happened. Our navy checked these ships. And we didn't have any incident. The sixth ship was very different. It had about 500 people on it of which about 450 were peaceful people. But several dozen were activists of a very radical group that had apparently amassed steel rods knives communication equipment. They boarded differently than the other passengers the other 450 passengers boarded in one port in Turkey. They went through security checks. These people boarded in another port in Istanbul. They didn't go through any security checks. They had their own communication equipment. They had their own -- their own steel pipes and things that they brought on board. And when our Coast Guard effectively wanted to check this ship and make sure that it behaved the way the other five did they were brutally attacked. You can see that in the films that were released. Our soldiers our navy people were fighting for their lives. What would you do if the Coast Guard boarded a ship and the Coast Guard was brutally attacked by people who were you know clubbing them knifing them taking weapons from them shooting at them? What do you think would happen? How do you think the American people would respond?,INTERVIEWER, OK. But how do you repair the damage with a state you need to be friendly Turkey?,INTERVIEWEE, Well you're quite right that Turkey and Israel had an important relationship. Turkey's a very important country in the Middle East. I think that the relationship began to deteriorate with the Turkish policy a new policy that basically veers away from the West and I think Israel -- what has happened with Israel as a result of that policy and not its cause. But nevertheless I look for every opportunity to see if we can stop this deterioration and somehow get things back to normal or relatively normal. Last week I authorized a meeting with one of my senior ministers and the Turkish foreign minister. They met in Zurich in the airport. I can't tell you that something positive came out of it. But I want to feel as prime minister of Israel that I leave no stone unturned in the quest for -- the quest for a broader peace and the quest of good relations with our neighbors. And even though it may not succeed right now we'll keep trying.,INTERVIEWER, Will you meet with Turkish leaders?,INTERVIEWEE, Sure.,INTERVIEWER, We're very interested in your comments Mr. Prime Minister on the statements made by former American President Jimmy Carter. He called the incident with the ship the attack on the ship unprovoked and an illegal Israeli assault. He also says there's no way to realize a two-state solution while quote "the people of Gaza remain isolated and deprived of basic human rights." How do you respond to President Carter?,INTERVIEWEE, Well first of all I think he's wrong on the incident. I described to you what happened.,INTERVIEWER, All right.,INTERVIEWEE, We regret the loss of life but we don't apologize for our soldiers defending themselves. And I think that's obvious. Secondly I think the people of Gaza are indeed incarcerated by Hamas. Third I removed all the civilian -- civilian closure that we had. That is the prevention of free flow of civilian goods food medicine anything toys. I actually changed a policy that I inherited from the previous government. And it put both civilian closure on Gaza and a security closure. I said we really have to be clear about our policy. Our policy is that weapons and war-supporting material don't go in. And everything else should go in. Food and everything else should go in. So I changed that policy. And I'm glad I did it because I think there's clarity and there's common sense in it. I'm sorry that not everyone can see that. But I think fair minded people can see it and in fact do.,INTERVIEWER, Does it pain you personally to have a former president of the United States be so critical of your country?,INTERVIEWEE, Well I'm sorry he thinks that. I think the majority -- the overwhelming majority of Americans see things differently. I think -- I think successful presidents including this one see things differently. And the important thing is to -- is to be true to the facts. The facts are that Israel was attacked from Gaza. The fact is that we had -- that Iran sends weapons into Gaza so they'd be fired on us. The fact is that this regime Hamas is holding an Israeli soldier that they kidnapped for four years. Four years this soldier Gilad Shalit has not been allowed to see anyone. They don't allow the Red Cross to visit him. This is a complete violation of international norms. I think if anything bears condemnation it is this -- this inhumane terrorist regime. And I would hope that international condemnation is directed there. That's where it belongs and not against Israel a struggling democracy striving to live and to make peace with its neighbors. It should not be condemned. It should be encouraged to --,INTERVIEWER, Does it concern you Mr. Prime Minister that Israel's image around the world is poor? You're not in high regard at the U.N. You seem to be from a public relations standpoint pr standpoint in trouble.,INTERVIEWEE, Well that's one of the reasons I'm appearing on "THE LARRY KING show." There's a difference between perception and reality. The reality is the people of Israel yearn for peace pray for peace. We've not had a day's peace a day of complete peace since the founding of the state in 1948. We know the cost of wars. There's -- many Israelis have suffered it. I've suffered it personally. I've lost a brother in the war between the wars known as terror. Many of my friends have lost direct relatives. We know the loss of war. We know the sorrows of war. We know the blessings of peace. Yet at the same time we forged a peace agreement with Egypt. We forged a peace agreement with Jordan. And throughout these years we built a robust economy. Israel is a beehive of creativity and innovation. The economy is growing. It's one of the best performing economies in the developed world. There's a story there that doesn't get told both of our desire for peace our sacrifices for peace and our building of a better reality. And I can envision if we had the kind of peace I envisioned with the Palestinians we could see what we're seeing now in the West Bank this great prosperity envelop the entire region. I think Israel could make a tremendous contribution to the well- being of its Arab neighbors. I think peace could bring for our children my children and their children something beyond their imagination. It could be a different life a different reality. And I'm prepared to do it. I'm prepared to move and lead my people to that peace. I need a partner on the other side.,INTERVIEWER, Mr. prime minister Iran how much -- the word fear apply -- how much do you fear their intentions? Do you -- do you -- what's the worst-case scenario to you?,INTERVIEWEE, Well we've learned in history and in Jewish history to take seriously those who call for our extermination. A lot of people in the past century the 20th century didn't take such calls seriously. And we know the awful price that was paid by the Jewish people and later by rest of humanity for not taking seriously these kinds of statements. The fact that after the Holocaust a sovereign government at once denies the Holocaust and calls for the destruction of the Jewish state is just outrageous. Do we take it seriously? Absolutely we take it seriously. We also know that Israel was founded to defend the Jewish people. So we reserve always the right to defend ourselves.,INTERVIEWER, If you determined that they had nuclear capability would you attack Iran?,INTERVIEWEE, You know I've taken note of President Obama's statement that he's determined to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. I see that sanctions have been adopted modest sanctions at the U.N. But more robust sanctions recently by the Congress was signed by the president the other day. I hope the other nations follow America's lead in this. Will it be enough to stop the Iranian nuclear program? I can't tell you Larry. I do tell you that the president has said that all options are on the table. And I do tell you that Israel always reserves the right to defend itself. That's the purpose for which it was founded to defend Jewish lives.,INTERVIEWER, Assuming -- Israel has never said it has nuclear weapons but the world thinks it does. Why is it OK for Israel to have nuclear weapons and Iran not to have nuclear weapons? Hypothetically if Israel has them why is it OK for them to have them and the other not?,INTERVIEWEE, Well we said we wouldn't be the first to introduce these weapons into the Middle East. But equally we're not threatening to destroy any country. We don't seek the destruction of any country or any people. We don't say that an entire people has to be wiped off the map of the Earth. We don't have such intentions. And I think all nuclear proliferation is bad. But some of it is a lot worse. It does make a difference whether Holland has nuclear weapons or the Ayatollah regime that sponsored terrorism and calls for Israel's destruction whether it is nuclear weapons. And I think there's a common understanding right now something that I spoke about 16 years ago 14 years -- to be precise 1996 when I was elected 14 years ago. I spoke before the joint session of the U.S. Congress. I was just elected prime minister. And I said that the greatest threat facing humanity is that Iran would acquire nuclear weapons. Some eyebrows were raised at the time. I can tell you 14 years later that most of the world's leaders today agree with this. There is a question of the distance between understanding and effective action and that is the ultimate test of leadership and history.,INTERVIEWER, Would you ban all nuclear weapons throughout the -- the world -- would you ban nuclear weaponry entirely?,INTERVIEWEE, Well that's beyond my scope. I mean this is -- this is a worthy cause but it's -- it's a very complicated issue. And I'm sure you realize that the most important thing is preventing the most dangerous weapons in the world from falling into the hands of the most dangerous regimes. And this is what we really are facing today. We're facing the prospect that people who talk about destruction who deny the Holocaust who sponsor terrorism everywhere who shoot their own citizens on the sidewalk -- you know they lie there. Remember that young woman lying there choking in her own blood. These people who have absolutely no inhibitions about the use of violence and brutality would acquire the weapons of mass terror the ultimate mass terror weapons which is atomic bombs. That's a very very dangerous development for all of us.,INTERVIEWER, Would there be any point -- may sound ridiculous but speaking is better than killing. Would there be any point for you to sit down with Ahmadinejad?,INTERVIEWEE, Well if he wanted to change the policies of Iran. We used to have friendly relations with Iran. It actually recognized Israel. We had exchanges all the time. But you know tell me -- when Ahmadinejad decides to recognize the state of Israel and seek peace with it believe me I'll be there eagerly waiting. But I'm afraid I don't see that. I see the very opposite. ,INTERVIEWER, We're back with Benjamin Netanyahu prime minister of Israel. So thankful to give us this hour tonight on "LARRY KING LIVE." As we say we go back a long way. What do you make of Iraq -- no no well I'm leaving "LARRY KING LIVE" in November. But I'm going to be around. We're going to do specials. We're going to come to the Middle East.,INTERVIEWEE, Oh good. Good I'll -- then I'll entertain you again in Israel. It will be a good refresher.,INTERVIEWER, It will be my pleasure. Don't forget you committed if we can get all three leaders on together we're going to do that show.,INTERVIEWEE, You can do it anytime. You have one.,INTERVIEWER, OK. Are you -- well I think we can get Jordan. If we get -- we're fine if we get Abbas. What do you make of what's going to happen in Iraq? Will that hold together?,INTERVIEWEE, I hope so. I mean we are -- we are rooting for the success of the American effort and of the Iraqi effort to stabilize Iraq. It went through a very difficult period. We want to see a peaceful Middle East. We want to see a moderate Middle East. I think there's a larger battle taking place between the forces of modernity and the forces of Medievalism. There's no other word that I could use to describe this militancy that tries not merely to eradicate Israel but to bring down any moderate government in the Arab world and in the Middle East. In a way there's a -- this is the first time in my lifetime that the -- many of the Arab governments and Israel understand that there's a great -- a great foe that threatens all of us. And that is the basis of a broader understanding. I don't think peace should be merely forged by common dangers. It should be forged also by the benefits the blessings of peace economic blessings the human blessings of every sort. But today the context of the peace is made perhaps more likely and more possible because of this common enemy that threatens Israel and Arab countries alike.,INTERVIEWER, What's -- what about Hezbollah Lebanon that -- four years since the war with Hezbollah and Lebanon. Are you still concerned about them?,INTERVIEWEE, Unfortunately yes because it is basically an Iranian terror proxy. Look Lebanon was the Switzerland of the Middle East. It had -- it's a very beautiful country. It had robust economy. And Iran has moved its surrogates Hezbollah into Lebanon. It has piled weapons there. They fire those weapons on Israel. They undermine any attempt at moderation any movement towards peace. We always hoped that Lebanon -- we always said we don't know who the first country to make peace with Israel which country that would be but certainly Lebanon would be the second country. And you know it hasn't happened not because many Lebanese don't want it but because radical forces pro-Iranian forces like Hezbollah are preventing it. And so you have these two enclaves next to Israel one in the south Gaza controlled by one proxy of Hezbollah preventing the people there from making peace with Israel. And then another enclave in the north in Lebanon controlled by another Iranian proxy Hezbollah preventing the Lebanese from making peace with Israel and threatening to throw the entire region into a maelstrom of violence and terror. That's happened before. I hope it doesn't happen again. But Hezbollah and Hamas are basically Iranian surrogates. As long as Iran doesn't want peace they don't want peace.,INTERVIEWER, Touch some other bases before you leave as we have one segment to go. You've invited President Obama to to visit Israel. What has he said?,INTERVIEWEE, Well you know he'll decide the appropriate time. But I have to tell you that we had a very very very productive conversation. And I think that when we have a chance to sit as we do one on one I think it's very very productive for Israel for the United States and for the quest for peace.,INTERVIEWER, Couple of other things Mr. prime minister. How would you describe the relationship of your country with Secretary of State Clinton? And how do you measure her work in the peace process?,INTERVIEWEE, I greatly respect Secretary Clinton. You know I worked with her husband Bill. I got to know Hillary on her visits to Israel. She's always a welcomed guest. I think she's knowledgeable. I think Secretary Clinton was a very wise choice on the part of President Obama. And we'll be happy to work with her if the president so designates and he often does.,INTERVIEWER, There's some video getting a lot of attention on the web supposedly of Israeli soldiers dancing while on patrol in Hebron. What do you know of that?,INTERVIEWEE, I don't know. I hear it for the first time.,INTERVIEWER, So do I. They gave me a note here and said it's on the web.,INTERVIEWEE, I don't know. If you talk to me -- if you want to invite me again I will be able to respond to it. ,INTERVIEWER, We'll invite you any time. Are you ever able -- you're prime minister of Israel. A previous prime minister was assassinated. You live in the center of a hostile world. Are you ever able to really relax?,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah. You know yes. And I'll tell you when. Every Saturday our Sabbath we have a day off. It's a very good idea that this institution was brought into the world. So I have a day off. And every Saturday I take an hour and a half and I read from the Bible with my younger boy. He has just won the National Bible Championship in Israel and he came third in the international. It's like the big spelling bee you know huge. I relax then. I draw a lot of spiritual strength. You know I used to teach him. He is now 15. But in the last couple of years he teaches me. So yes I draw enormous reservoirs of strength and I think that is needed for all leaders but especially for the leaders of Israel.,INTERVIEWER, Four years ago the former prime minister Ariel Sharon suffered a stroke. He is still alive. Do you ever go to see him? What is that story?,INTERVIEWEE, It's a tragedy. Ariel Sharon was one of the great leaders of Israel. He's in my judgment the greatest general that Israel has had in modern times. He has contributed a lot to the country. And unfortunately he suffered as you say the stroke. We can all pray that somehow he miraculously recovers. But that has not happened yet. But I think the people of Israel value his contributions. I certainly do.,INTERVIEWER, Earlier in the program you mentioned that Hamas is still holding Gilad Shalit -- I believe that's the way you pronounce his name -- the Israeli soldier they captured four years ago.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, Any late word on any efforts?,INTERVIEWEE, Well we've had a German mediator very able man trying to broker the release. I'm prepared to release 1000 Palestinian prisoners for Gilad. But so far there's not been an official response of Hamas to this offer that the mediator has made. I have accepted it. They have not. I can only hope that they change their mind.,INTERVIEWER, In our remaining moments Mr. prime minister do you think -- how old are you now?,INTERVIEWEE, I'm 60 years old Larry. And showing it.,INTERVIEWER, Do you think that in your lifetime you will really see peace in your region?,INTERVIEWEE, I think it's possible to achieve it yes. Will we achieve it with the entire Middle East? That I cannot say. Can we achieve it with the Palestinians? I say absolutely. I say that with conviction because I think it's a question of a rightness for our people's perspective. There is already time. It's now. I think for many Palestinians the time is now. And I'm prepared to make that effort. It requires a lot of courage. Maybe that's the quality that supersedes all others. Because if you don't have courage everything else fails. But if you have it then everything else is possible. We have the courage to make peace. And I hope -- I fervently hope that our Palestinian neighbors have similar courage. With the help of the United States I think it can be done yeah. Absolutely.,INTERVIEWER, Thank you Mr. prime minister. Have a safe trip home. We hope to see you again very soon.,INTERVIEWEE, Thank you. Come and visit us Larry. Thank you.,INTERVIEWER, Queen Latifah Grammy winner Oscar nominated actress entrepreneur philanthropist great talent and author of a new book "Put on Your Crown: Life-Changing Moments on the Path To Queendom." She's with us for the full hour. It's always great to see her. Tell me about this title. What do we mean by "put on your crown"?,INTERVIEWEE, First of all thank you for having me here Larry.,INTERVIEWER, You're welcome darling.,INTERVIEWEE, I feel like every woman is a queen and we should be treated as such and we should you know sort of request that sort of treatment from others. So putting on your crown is really like accepting the fact that you are a queen. You're a great woman. Wherever you are in life just keep on that path and so for me sometimes as women we forget -- we forget that about ourselves. So putting on your crown is sort of reminding yourself that hey I'm a queen and I can do what I want in this life and take it you know --,INTERVIEWER, This is a how-to book?,INTERVIEWEE, It's actually more of a conversation. Just a conversation that I'm having with the readers sharing some of my experiences and how I you know went through certain life-changing moments. Whether they were positive or negative and how I responded to those situations and just continue to move on through life.,INTERVIEWER, Written any particular age group?,INTERVIEWEE, No. I think it's for maybe teenage girls through 65- year-old women you know. I mean because it's about those moments and I'm 40 at this point. So I'm sort of in the middle. I find that we need inspiration all through life and self-esteem is something that you don't just get a self-esteem card that lasts for the rest of your life. Sometimes you have to be reminded and maintain that high self-esteem to do things that really encourage you to be in a positive place and surround yourself with positive people and that kind of thing so --,INTERVIEWER, You write that Sinatra's "I'm Going to Live Until I Die" great song. A lot of people recorded it.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, It's your anthem right?,INTERVIEWEE, It is you know. I mean to me life is for the living you know. It's about living every moment to the full as best you can.,INTERVIEWER, That's hard though isn't it?,INTERVIEWEE, It is hard sometimes but to me it's a goal. It's a goal if you will. I try to keep it in mind in you know whatever I do I'll try to make sure I have a good time doing it that I enjoy it and that I get every full moment out of everything that I do.,INTERVIEWER, You right frankly in the book about being molested as a child.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, That had to change your -- how old were you?,INTERVIEWEE, 5.,INTERVIEWER, That doesn't leave you though does it?,INTERVIEWEE, No it doesn't. It doesn't.,INTERVIEWER, So do you use -- how do you apply it? Being a queen one day?,INTERVIEWEE, I mean luckily my parents really just raised me to be that way and they didn't know. And it took me to lose my brother to actually tell my parents what had happened to me because once I lost my brother Lance it was --,INTERVIEWER, How old was he?,INTERVIEWEE, He was 24 at the time. I was 22.,INTERVIEWER, What happened (ph)?,INTERVIEWEE, Motorcycle accident. We rode motorcycles. Yes he had a motorcycle accident. But after that we were very very close. So after that happened I just couldn't hold it anymore and I told my mom and she was devastated because,INTERVIEWER, Did they know the party?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, That's more devastated.,INTERVIEWEE, And I was scared to tell my father because I'm like my father's going to kill him you know and I'm like I don't want to do that but I had to. I had to you know let them know what I gone through so that they could understand maybe more of my mindset and freed myself of that burden you know. It's enough carrying it for too long.,INTERVIEWER, You also write about being broke at one point.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, You were broke broke? I mean that's like,INTERVIEWEE, Maybe not quite broke broke.,INTERVIEWER, How close to being broke broke?,INTERVIEWEE, Well what had happened was I had over invested in my company and just poured money into it and really didn't pay attention to what was coming in and going out. I was relying on other people to take care of things for me. I wasn't signing my own checks. I was doing the work but I wasn't paying attention to the dollars and how they were flowing in and out from my personal expenses to my company expenses and you know we just were investing in this dream. I mean we were you know -- these kids who had all of these ideas and all of this ability this drive determination able to create things and make things happen but you know we never went to business school. So like certain things that we just didn't do right and I wound (ph) up with a big tax bill that was due and I had paid all of these bills for all of these things and I didn't have the money to cover it. So I was kind of broke. And -- just talk to my accountant and figured out obviously. We had to negotiate with the IRS. Get on plan to pay off these you know payment plan.,INTERVIEWER, They can be good about it though right?,INTERVIEWEE, They were agreeable. They were pretty agreeable. They worked with us fairly well on it and I was able to kind of knock it out but the shock that you have you know a $1 million bill to pay with the IRS and it's not there is like oh my God you know. It freaked me out.,INTERVIEWER, All of these things. You're close to your brother. In fact you write that his loss took you so far into darkness people worried you'd never come back. Later you go broke. How can you put on your crown?,INTERVIEWEE, Because that's what it's about. It's about those moments that happen in your life. Those times those things that happen in your life and how you respond to them. It's not just about what happens. It's about your response to it. So the response is not to lay down and die you know to just take it. Response is to challenge it to fight back. to fight through to fight through it and these are very difficult things. I mean just reading the audio book for this book really -- I mean just reading a chapter about my brother I was in tears in the studio reading this thing because it took me right back to all of those you know to that whole experience but you know God is good. I'm going to tell you that Larry. God is good and God really brought me through that because it was a very very difficult -- it's the most difficult thing I've been through in my entire life. To lose someone that you are so close to -- I remember like my hands got weak. I lost the strength in my hands. Like I couldn't make a fist. We're fighters in our family. We like to wrestle and have fun but I lost the strength in my hands. And I was like wow. We were that close that I'm losing you know that I became weak but you know he's an angel and I have many people praying for me and I was able to kind of get through it.,INTERVIEWER, The book is "Put on Your Crown" the guest is terrifically talented Queen Latifah. It's always great to have her with us. You also write about a DUI incident that led you to a wake-up call about alcohol.,INTERVIEWEE, Oh boy.,INTERVIEWER, Were you addicted?,INTERVIEWEE, No no but I think you know when you do what we do for a living you're in entertainment you're in the spotlight and you have to carry you know wear a lot of hats and you -- I think at that time I was just maybe using alcohol to numb whatever that I was you know whatever emotions I was dealing with whatever I was exhausted about and I just didn't pay attention and it was kind of like a -- God just pulled my skirt a little bit and said wake up girl. Get it together you know. And I,INTERVIEWER, Did you have to go to court?,INTERVIEWEE, Not actually have to appear in court. I did have to go to court you know to deal with it but for me more importantly it was about paying attention to my own emotions and my own feelings and the things that I'm dealing with and not to use alcohol as something to mask anything else you know but really just get on point. Pay attention. And I thought about -- and I'm so thankful that -- that I had that wake-up call because I thought about all the times you know all the people who you know are killed in drunk driving accidents and I was -- I could have been -- it could have been a lot worse. It actually wasn't a DUI. It was a reckless driving. I was not actually impaired but I was over the legal limit. And it just made me think that's not responsible. That's not the right thing to do. Wake up. Get it together you know. I'm fine with checking myself when I'm you know when I'm not doing the right thing.,INTERVIEWER, Do you think maybe she should read this book. Do you think Lindsay Lohan can get it together?,INTERVIEWEE, I think anybody who has an opportunity to have treatment for an addiction and she obviously has some addictions that she's dealing with can bounce back from it. But it can take years you know. I have a lot of people in my family who have dealt with substance abuse and some of them it took 20 years but they did get it together eventually. But you have to deal with that as a disease as an addiction not just as -- here's a wild party crazy girl you know. This is just a human being dealing who's with an addiction and you have to look at it like that. And if they get the proper treatment and they're able to you know really face it then I think anybody can overcome.,INTERVIEWER, In this day and age you're candid about many things. You don't discuss your personal life which is fully your business.,INTERVIEWEE, No Larry. Don't go there Larry.,INTERVIEWER, I'm not. But how do you protect in this day and age 24/7 internet how do you protect any kind of privacy? Anybody. How do you protect it?,INTERVIEWEE, How do you protect it? You can't protect it.,INTERVIEWER, I can't. You can't. You walk down the street they take your picture. Why?,INTERVIEWEE, I know. You know that the thing is for me I just feel like -- I mean I don't read all of the blogs and I'm not media hungry like that. I don't have to look at myself online every day. I live my life. You write about my life. You write about what you see. I share with the public the things that we should share. We should share music --,INTERVIEWER, It's nobody's business.,INTERVIEWEE, I mean we share my music. Let's share that. Let's share films. Let's share that. Let's share thoughts about you know positive things. Let's share those thing but what happens in my personal personal life is my personal business.,INTERVIEWER, Do you think the public has come know it all list that kind of expects things?,INTERVIEWEE, I mean I think they do. I mean it's become a media frenzy to you know kind of feed on people's personal lives and some people put their personal lives out there. They like to share all that with the public.,INTERVIEWER, That I can't figure.,INTERVIEWEE, I mean I'm not that person. I'm happy being you know just locked. When I'm off -- when I walk out of this studio I'm just Dana. I enjoy just being Dana. I don't need to be Queen Latifah the brand 24 hours a day you know,INTERVIEWER, Who came up with that queen did?,INTERVIEWEE, I did thank you. Yes. I'm pretty good at coming up with things like that Larry.,INTERVIEWER, One day you're sitting around and said I think my name will be Queen?,INTERVIEWEE, OK. It's going to sound kind of crazy but I was 8 years old and my cousin Shoranda (ph) brought this Muslim book of names over. And each name had a meaning to it. So when I read the name Latifah it said delicate sensitive kind nice. And I was 8 years old but I was big for my age. I was usually like the biggest girl in class but I was a teddy bear on the inside. I was all those things. Delicate sensitive kind and nice. And I thought to myself that should be my name. I know I'm 8 but this is where my brain went. So Latifah became my nickname when I was 8. And then when it came time when I started rapping and it became you know it came time for me to decide what my professionally known name would be. My lawyer asked me what do you want to be professionally known as? I kicked a bunch of things around. I didn't want to be emcee Latifah or you know all these different monikers that you could have put on but I thought Queen you know. My mom raised me to be a queen. Queen. Queen Latifah. And I asked all my boys and they thought it was cool. So I went with it Larry. I went with it.,INTERVIEWER, Good move.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, We'll be back with the queen.,INTERVIEWEE, With the queen.,INTERVIEWER, We're back with Queen Latifah. The book "Put On Your Crown." This is guaranteed best-seller of course I'm going to leave it to you who wrote it (ph). You recently hosted the BET Awards.,INTERVIEWEE, I had a blast.,INTERVIEWER, Singing with Chris Brown do a tribute performance of Michael Jackson's "Man in the Mirror." becoming very emotional. You later said he needs to be forgiven in connection with the abuse thing with Rihanna. Why does he need to be forgiven and there are some people who thought he was not sincere. What's your overriding thought on all this?,INTERVIEWEE, For me being there and seeing that performance I think he was completely sincere number one. And I'm sure many things were going through his mind. Number one it's a Michael Jackson tribute. So just to the hear Michael Jackson's music and to see the dance and to feel that energy was one thing that was already happening but I really -- I really feel like he was also you know taking responsibility for what he's been through and he's a young guy. I mean how long we going to beat the guy up for? I mean they both moved on. They both accepted what happened. He's paid the penalty and hopefully he's learned from it but he's young. He needs an opportunity to learn and grow. I'm not saying he was right by any means. like I completely disagree with any man putting their hands on a woman ever however people when they're young and emotional they need to learn how to deal with their emotions and especially if you've grown up around abuse it's something that is you know you've seen and you've -- you know accepted it or you desensitized to it to some degree. So now it's time to get more sensitive to it. To really never do it again and learn from it but I mean I think at some point we can't keep Chris Browning him to death. You know what I mean? ,INTERVIEWER, During the BET Awards Queen Latifah changed costumes many times. Putting on outfits she wore for various movies and TV shows. Look. You've gone up and down weight wise. You have to change clothes a lot?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes. I lost weight during our show changing all those outfits. I was exhausted but I had so much fun and it was kind of fun having a little walk through time. But no weight's good.,INTERVIEWER, You were a basketball player as kid right? Pretty good?,INTERVIEWEE, I was pretty good. I wouldn't say I'm a superstar nothing like that Larry but I think I was pretty good.,INTERVIEWER, Michelle Obama's brother guest on this show recently Craig Robertson coaches Oregon State believes that people reveal their true character on a basketball court.,INTERVIEWEE, I believe that. I believe that. Because you know -- and you know what I love playing organized sports. It taught me a lot. Taught me how to be a team player taught me how to sacrifice how to share how to celebrate how to compete how to be composed. One of the things my coach always drove into our head was composure. Composure. Composure. So all of these things that I learned playing basketball I was able to take into life into this career you know. How to be composed under pressure. You can't shoot a movie without 150 people you know. They're all there. We all make it happen together. So that teaches you how to be a team player. I need to work with you customs wardrobe hair lighting grips. Everyone has to work together. So a lot of those lessons you definitely can take into life.,INTERVIEWER, Queen played a diehard basketball fan in her recent movie "Just Right." Here's a clip.,INTERVIEWEE, You must be talking about Randolph (ph) versus MLK 1993? Sophomore year he scored 23 points in the first half another 32 in the second half 18 rebounds 10 assists 9 steals breaking the high school record for double digits in a single game? I've been a basketball fan since before I could walk so --,INTERVIEWER, You did a pretty wild love scene in that movie.,INTERVIEWEE, Easy Larry.,INTERVIEWER, With rap star Common. No. Was it hard -- with 150 people around was it hard to do it?,INTERVIEWEE, You're not allowed to have 150 people around doing a love scene.,INTERVIEWER, What? Two cameramen?,INTERVIEWEE, You know what oddly enough that was -- that was like a day off for me. I mean because I produced as well as acted in this film. So I was wearing a lot of hats through the whole movie and that day when we had to shoot our love scene I just asked Common. I said Common you got me? He was like I got you. I said all right. Let me relax and the just be a lady you know. You handle this woman right here and he had me. So I was -- in between him and the director center who made sure everything looked right I felt quite comfortable.,INTERVIEWER, We're back the book "Put On Your Crown" the guest Queen Latifah. She was Dana Owens in Newark New Jersey. Ever feel like Queen Latifah has taken over that you are a brand and that's a big word these days? A brand. You're Coca-Cola.,INTERVIEWEE, I'm coca-cola Pepsi and them you know. Let me get my soda on. No. Queen Latifah outgrew me years ago and I remembered it. I remember I was 24 years old I was doing "Living Single" and I had a record out and so many things were happening. All of these articles and covers and -- I was like this is way beyond who I am. This is now gone to a whole new level. And which made me even more so want to just be me. To stick -- I mean I still have the same energy I had since the beginning over 20 years now. We've known each other since high school. I still work with a lot of my friend who I've known since high school. So I have real people around me who can pat me on my back when I'm doing good and smack my hand when I'm doing something naughty and it just keeps me more grounded. Queen Latifah became a phenomenon in a sense but underneath the queen is just locked. And I think that's what people really get from me and what they feel like -- when people approach me on the street they just feel like they could hug me you know. Like they feel like they know me and they say that to me. It's just because I'm still me. Underneath all that huge Queen Latifah business it's just --,INTERVIEWER, Did you ever miss not being known on the street? Not being famous?,INTERVIEWEE, I remember losing my anonymity. I mean especially growing up in New York -- well New Jersey but I hung out in New York a lot. You know? You could go to New York and just be anyone you wanted to be. You could disappear into eight million people. And you could change your name or wear a different outfit and --,INTERVIEWER, You must miss some of that?,INTERVIEWEE, I do miss it but I mean I've been doing this a long time. At some point you just get used to it. That's why like I said it's really important that when I'm off I just get to relax and do normal things and not be in a spotlight. I don't crave it like that.,INTERVIEWER, You believe in change. You believe obviously people can overcome things.,INTERVIEWEE, I do.,INTERVIEWER, Can Tiger Woods overcome?,INTERVIEWEE, You know Larry you asked me about Tiger Woods before and we going to leave Tiger alone.,INTERVIEWER, I'm not -- I like Tiger.,INTERVIEWEE, Listen I think anybody is capable of overcoming challenges you know with the right things in their life. The right -- number one I think God can do all things. So -- and people praying for you means something. And I think he can overcome whatever challenges he faces. I think underneath all of that I think maybe he lost his self in there along the way and he just has to get centered again. And I think he gets that. So why not?,INTERVIEWER, You mention God a lot. Have you always believed?,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah.,INTERVIEWER, In the darkest days?,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah I have actually.,INTERVIEWER, Ever doubted?,INTERVIEWEE, Doubted? No. Questioned? Yes. But -- but for me I think God is much bigger than what we can see in our minds. I think it's OK to be angry sometimes or to be sad or to shout or question. But I think the most important thing is the faith to know that you are covered and you'll get these answers when the time is right and just to know -- just to have that faith. Even though you can't touch it or see it or things aren't exactly how you want it at the time you just have to know it's going to happen. He's got you. He's got you Larry. You stay strong brother. You stay strong.,INTERVIEWER, I'll try. Not always easy. Jennifer Hudson co-starred with you in "The Secret Life of Bees" suffered the murder of her young mother brother and young nephew. Have you talked to her?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, How's she doing?,INTERVIEWEE, She's doing great.,INTERVIEWER, That's tough to recover.,INTERVIEWEE, When I see her she is doing great. She is a strong amazing woman. And what a tragedy but I think she has God and he'll see her through. You know that's where I'll leave that.,INTERVIEWER, When you think of you first what -- are you a singer actress entrepreneur? Queen Latifah what is the occupation on the diver's license?,INTERVIEWEE, Daughter. Daughter of Rita and Lance. I think I start at daughter. I'm a sister an aunt. I'm that friend. I'm all those things before I become a rapper.,INTERVIEWER, Are you the glue of the family?,INTERVIEWEE, I don't think I'm the glue. I think there's a lot of glue in the family. We all keep each other together.,INTERVIEWER, Ever go back to Newark?,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah. That's where my family's at. So I have to go back. I have to see me family my friends.,INTERVIEWER, Now you're going have the Nets and a new soccer stadium.,INTERVIEWEE, I know. The soccer stadium looks amazing too.,INTERVIEWER, Betty White was in the movie "Bringing Down The House" that you did with Steve Martin. One of the funniest movies ever made. Ever made "Bringing Down The House." Did you have fun doing that?,INTERVIEWEE, I had so much fun doing that movie it makes no sense. And Betty White that's my girl.,INTERVIEWER, What do you make of her? She's now a king of the world -- queen -- she's a queen.,INTERVIEWEE, Exactly. I cannot stop watching her on SNL. I keep pulling it up online. I'm like memorizing scenes. She is so funny. And I can't wait to see her new show. I hope it's just a big smash hit. I hope it's a big hit.,INTERVIEWER, The whole thing was the Snicker's commercial in the Super Bowl brought her back.,INTERVIEWEE, I mean she got tackled. It's hilarious. Betty is great because she's not afraid to laugh at herself. She doesn't take herself seriously. It's the people who take themselves seriously that look kind of ridiculous.,INTERVIEWER, OK Queen your state is now a reality TV sensation. "The Jersey Shore." "The Real Housewives of New Jersey" there's a tendency to make fun of it. It's the middle state between New York and Pennsylvania.,INTERVIEWEE, I know. People are starting to find out that we got a cozy little spot there.,INTERVIEWER, How do you feel about the way Jersey is being imaged if that's a word?,INTERVIEWEE, Jersey has always been imaged in a weird way. You know? Where you from Jersey? OK. What exit? Associated with mobsters and stuff like that.,INTERVIEWER, Very bad somewhere out there.,INTERVIEWEE, I know. But New Jersey is a great place to live. And we have given some of the best talent to the world from Jack Nicholson John Travolta to Jerry Lewis to Bon Jovi to Frank Sinatra. You know what I mean?,INTERVIEWER, Not bad with that one.,INTERVIEWEE, The Fugees Queen Latifah. I mean we have something about us that I think -- we just have this thing. And we're able to move around the world. Everywhere I go I seem to run into somebody from Jersey. And they seem to know that -- we all seem to know we're from Jersey for some reason. ,INTERVIEWER, Do you mind the reality shows?,INTERVIEWEE, I mean it's just a reality show. Aren't all reality shows reality shows?,INTERVIEWER, What do you make of the popularity? They are cheap. They're easy to put on.,INTERVIEWEE, OK Larry. Whatever you say man. Whatever you say. You tell me.,INTERVIEWER, I don't understand at all.,INTERVIEWEE, People like watching other people's lives. That's just what it is. This was predicted to happen a long time ago and now it's here and people just really are fascinated by watching other people's lives. I think you know shows like "The Real Housewives of Jersey and " The Jersey Shore" they're just very entertaining. I did Jay Leno with Mike the Situation and he just -- he lives like ten minutes from me in Jersey. He's like if you ever get a flat call me. I'll come fix your tire. That's how we do. That's neighborly you know?,INTERVIEWER, Did you run into a lot of -- was there a lot of prejudices in the town?,INTERVIEWEE, Prejudice in America -- of course you run into prejudice. When the cab doesn't stop for me and it stops for the white guy that's prejudice. That's racism.,INTERVIEWER, That would drive me nuts.,INTERVIEWEE, It -- you know what? It's hurtful. It drives you nuts but you don't let it break you. You know? We strong resilient people. We are not going to let something break us. We just bounce back. You find a way. You find a way. And also we try to build bridges to combat that. That's why music -- I love making music because music is universal. When I first started rapping people thought hip-hop was a fad. It was going to die. It's ruining the people the kids. Don't let your child listen to this. Now you got people rapping all around the globe in every language.,INTERVIEWER, My kids. When you started were there female rappers?,INTERVIEWEE, There weren't a lot. There were never a lot of female rappers. There were a lot more when I started than there are now.,INTERVIEWER, Less now.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes less now less that are out that we have records playing on the radio. But I think there's going to be a resurgence. I think the call is on for more female voices in hip-hop. You have to have that balance. If you don't have it then there's something missing.,INTERVIEWER, How does it feel to be 40? ,INTERVIEWEE, It feels pretty good Larry.,INTERVIEWER, Is 40 the old 30? Sixty is the old 50.,INTERVIEWEE, I don't know. People can keep,INTERVIEWER, Some people put an onus on 40 and life begins at 40. Forty is middle age.,INTERVIEWEE, You know my grandmother Inez Owens god bless her passed away at 94. And when I tell you her spirit was that of a 19- year-old at 94 -- I just just never looked at age the same way other people did. I wasn't one of those people that was freaked out when I turned 30. I don't have this done. I don't put time limits on when I have to do this. I'm going to do this at 25 that at 30. Because life is change. It changes. And what happens along your path is what happens while you're going there. So you can't just limit yourself. What happens if you don't meet that deadline? Do you just fall apart or do you push through it and keep going? Or do you figure out a new thing a new plan? So for me like I always hung out around people that were usually about four years older than me. And they made life look so interesting and fun that I've never looked at age as being something that you had to behave a certain way. To me it's about how you feel inside and how you live your life. So 40's good; 40's good Lar.,INTERVIEWER, In some of your early movies -- the book "Put On Your Crown" the guest Queen Latifah -- you were killed off. Is it true that there's now a death clause in your contract that Queen Latifah cannot die in a film?,INTERVIEWEE, No dying allowed anymore.,INTERVIEWER, Is that true?,INTERVIEWEE, I did. It was kind of a joke but -- excuse me. I think I just died too well on camera.,INTERVIEWER, Supposing you get -- supposing someone gives you a great script a phenomenal -- this is Oscar stuff. You were nominated for an Oscar -- you got to die?,INTERVIEWEE, I might be flexible.,INTERVIEWER, There's a death scene? Runs about eight minutes just you into the camera.,INTERVIEWEE, Wow eight Minutes. Where's the camera. Push in. Come closer. Come. Closer.,INTERVIEWER, Don't. Ever turn down a role that you regretted?,INTERVIEWEE, No. No.,INTERVIEWER, Never had that happen?,INTERVIEWEE, I have never turned down a role and regretted it. I usually go with my gut.,INTERVIEWER, Your mom Rita Ray Owens part of the new book anyway even wrote part of a chapter called "Love." Why is she this close? Why are you so close to her?,INTERVIEWEE, My mom is just like -- she's just like my best friend. There's nothing that I can't talk to her about. There's nothing that she can't talk to me about.,INTERVIEWER, A lot of mothers and daughters divide along the way. You know that's true?,INTERVIEWEE, It's true. Like because girls we act up. Mama's want to spank us. No. But my mother and I we've never had that relationship. Even when I was being rebellious or challenging or questioning certain things I still had respect for my mother and I knew that I could rely on her. She's always been there. And I think my mother she's an artist. She was an art teacher. She's an art -- she's a creative person. And she fed so many parts of who I am. She was fascinated by my brother and I. Like she spent a lot of time with us and watched us and allowed us to do things to discover who we are and encouraged those things as opposed to forcing us to do one thing and limiting us. And so I mean even my friends My friends love my mom. They all know they can talk to her. When everything is crazy and no one else can calm me down my mother just has this soothing voice. You know? And I'm good.,INTERVIEWER, You think you'd be a great mother?,INTERVIEWEE, I think I will.,INTERVIEWER, Want kids.,INTERVIEWEE, I'm pregnant. Just kidding. Calm down. Thought you had the scoop. No.,INTERVIEWER, You would be a great mother.,INTERVIEWEE, I think I would be a great mom. And I'm definitely planning on doing that.,INTERVIEWER, You're doing a new movie in Chicago right?,INTERVIEWEE, Oh yeah.,INTERVIEWER, With Kevin James and Vince Vaughn right?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, I don't imagine then is a serious drama?,INTERVIEWEE, It is so dramatic. And I'm going to die. It's going to take me eight minutes but I'm definitely going to die.,INTERVIEWER, Ron Howard is directing it.,INTERVIEWEE, Ron Howard is directing it. It will be hilarious. Just our rehearsal was so much fun.,INTERVIEWER, What's the title?,INTERVIEWEE, It's tentatively titled "Cheaters" right now. But it may change by the time it comes out. Vince is so spontaneous so quick-witted and just funny just dead funny. I can't wait to do it. I look forward to it.,INTERVIEWER, Ron doesn't do many comedies.,INTERVIEWEE, No. Ron is so good.,INTERVIEWER, He must be a wonderful director to work for.,INTERVIEWEE, Oh man. It's hard for me because when I'm around him I'm like --,INTERVIEWER, He's Opie.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes. Yes. I mean yes. Stars still get star struck you know? And I just grew up watching him. And I watched how amazing a director he became and what kind of great films he made and it was just like -- I'm just very honored to be able to work with him.,INTERVIEWER, Was it tough to be nominated and lose?,INTERVIEWEE, No. I made a lot of money after that.,INTERVIEWER, Just getting nominated.,INTERVIEWEE, I got paid Larry. No it was great to be nominated because it's a small club. It is a small club. Everybody doesn't get nominated for an Oscar. Yes. I was with a great people. It was a "Chicago" sweep and was as part of a great film. Everyone fired all pistons on that movie. And to be part of it and to have the opportunities that came to me as a result of being nominated and that film -- the weekend of the Oscars when "Chicago" was out "Bringing Down the House" was the number one movie in the box office. So it made like 37 million. I'm sitting at the Oscars. There's Tom Denzel Merryl. I get to say things like that. And my film just kicked off. So it was a good thing for me. I was happy.,INTERVIEWER, Because?,INTERVIEWEE, She's avant-guard. She's extremely talented. She shakes things up a little bit. She works really hard. So I like that.,INTERVIEWER, This is from "Put on Your Crown".,INTERVIEWEE, This is if I ran into the 19-year-old version of myself "If I ran into a 19-year-old version of myself I would just tell her to live full out. I might also tell her to go ahead and have a few babies and not worry about the timing of it. But mostly I'd tell her that she's stronger than she thinks that she shouldn't doubt herself on her path. I'd say Dana do you know who you are? Guess who you get to be? And guess what? You even get to lose weight. "No. No you're good. You're good. Just keep doing your thing. And I say the same thing to you: celebrate make every moment count walk tall wear your crown with pride.",INTERVIEWER, How should reader use this book?,INTERVIEWEE, However they feel. This is not -- I'm not preaching to people. This is really more of a conversation about my path through life. And I find by sharing true things about the ups and downs and how I respond to them I find that people can share that. Maybe someone can skip going through something that I had to go through. Or if they're going through something and they need a little inspiration maybe they'll find some of these words inspirational. I found that a lot of fans have inspired me through the years by just saying certain things to keep me going. So why not give that back? Why not share you know amongst one of -- amongst ourselves some positive vibes. That's all just positive inspiration and maybe a few tools to get to where you need to go. Or maybe if you've been stuck in a rut shake it up a little bit. You know? And shake it off. And try try again. You know? Just keep moving forward.,INTERVIEWER, One other thing about "Chicago" you looked like you were having so much fun making that movie. It must have been hard work.,INTERVIEWEE, It was very challenging. Doing musicals is usually six weeks of rehearsal two weeks singing two weeks acting two weeks choreography and dance. But I love that. I live for that. And being in the hands of Rob Marshall who --,INTERVIEWER, Yeah.,INTERVIEWEE, -- the most gracious and incredible director. To see you know -- especially at that time I wasn't quite where I am now in terms of status. So to see Catherine Zeta-Jones humble Rene Zellweger humble Richard Gear humble in the hands of this guy. Everyone checked their egos at the door and said OK what do we have to do? And just worked so hard. He delivered for all of us.,INTERVIEWER, Have you seen the show on Broadway?,INTERVIEWEE, Not yet.,INTERVIEWER, You still haven't seen "Chicago.",INTERVIEWEE, Oh "Chicago" yeah.,INTERVIEWER, You saw it?,INTERVIEWEE, Oh yes.,INTERVIEWER, Did that affect the way you played it?,INTERVIEWEE, No because I was -- my mama is a completely different mama. I had to be Latifah mama not anyone else's. So what I did love was that there were a lot of the Broadway actors and dancers in the actual movie. So seeing how amazingly they executed it live and seeing them bring it to the -- to the film was wonderful.,INTERVIEWER, Enjoy having you with us Queen.,INTERVIEWEE, Thank you.,INTERVIEWER, Queen Latifah. The book "Put on Your Crown".,INTERVIEWEE, Put it on.,INTERVIEWER, Put it on.,INTERVIEWEE, Your crown.,INTERVIEWER, Time now for "AC 360.",INTERVIEWEE, Get you some.,INTERVIEWER, Wanda Sykes thank you for coming.,INTERVIEWEE, Thank you. Thank you for having me here.,INTERVIEWER, Were you a funny kid?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes I was a funny kid and -- but my timing was off. Yeah because instead of getting the laughs I would get popped in the lips you know.,INTERVIEWER, Where did you grow up?,INTERVIEWEE, Virginia Portsmouth Virginia.,INTERVIEWER, Did you want to be a comedian?,INTERVIEWEE, No. I didn't know any comedians. You know--,INTERVIEWER, So how did this all happen?,INTERVIEWEE, I have no idea.,INTERVIEWER, You woke up on stage? What?,INTERVIEWEE, You know I went through the steps that you know you're supposed to go through. I went to school. Went to college. And at that time we were living in the Maryland D.C. area. So you know what do you do you get a job for the government. So I was working for the government. And I was just bored silly. And I said this cannot be my life. You know? And it was just the same thing. I would you know go to work and come home drink some beer wash my car. I had to clean this car on the block because it was like every day -- out of boredom.,INTERVIEWER, So how do you break into comedy from that?,INTERVIEWEE, One day I was like going through my high school yearbook. I was just looking at what you know people had written in my book. And it was you're so funny. You should be on stage. And you know I was always a fan of comedy. But I said you know what maybe I should. So I just -- I wrote some jokes and went on stage. And it all just kind of made sense.,INTERVIEWER, The rest as they say is history.,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah yeah.,INTERVIEWER, How do you feel about this nomination? Emmy nominated.,INTERVIEWEE, I'm very excited about it very honored. You know last week we had the Creative Arts Awards. And I lost that one. And you know you get all dressed up and you go. And you know people say oh I'm just so honored to be nominated but really you want to win. You know it feel goods to win. You want to walk around with your big trophy--,INTERVIEWER, Damn right.,INTERVIEWEE, --and you want to shove it in people's faces. And you know you want to get up and thank people. I mean you want to do all that. So when -- you know when they didn't call my name it would have been better for me if they would have said and the winner is Wanda Sykes not you. You know I would have felt better. I would have said oh okay Because just punching--,INTERVIEWER, Who one?,INTERVIEWEE, --if you're going to kick me in the teeth kick me in the teeth.,INTERVIEWER, Who won?,INTERVIEWEE, The Kennedy Center Honors.,INTERVIEWER, You're kidding?,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah yeah.,INTERVIEWER, I mean it's night and day.,INTERVIEWEE, Thank you thank you Larry. Why am I up against Bruce Springsteen's and Melissa Etheridge's entire body of work? My one hour?,INTERVIEWER, Well Jimmy Fallon is going to be here tomorrow night. Maybe we'll talk to him into -- is there still time to influence -,INTERVIEWEE, Yes. Yeah yeah right.,INTERVIEWER, I'll do what I can.,INTERVIEWEE, I'm sure PriceWaterhouse will love that. Yeah.,INTERVIEWER, Let's get into politics. Were you always political?,INTERVIEWEE, I think growing up in like the Washington D.C./Maryland area. Because we moved there my father was in the military. I think you know I was just so exposed to it that you know it's just what's around. So I was involved and interested. And then as I got older I just found it all fascinating and such a -- full of hypocrisy. And that's the best comedy to me is when you're pointing fingers at you know at society and at our system so--,INTERVIEWER, Speaking of hypocrisy--,INTERVIEWEE, Uh-huh.,INTERVIEWER, Right? And let's go right to it. Ken Mehlman the former chairman of the Republican party?,INTERVIEWEE, He's family. I didn't know. Look at that.,INTERVIEWER, Yes he's one of you.,INTERVIEWEE, He's one of me.,INTERVIEWER, He came out of the closet. He came out against Prop 8. What do you make of that? You mention hypocrisy.,INTERVIEWEE, Right. And that's the whole thing with politics. Here's this guy. Now he said it's taken him like 43 years to you know be comfortable with you know himself his own self-,INTERVIEWER, Self yes.,INTERVIEWEE, --which I understand. You know it took me a while to publicly come out. But the people back then when he was in the Bush administration come on they knew. They knew he was gay and he had to sit there and listen to--,INTERVIEWER, Anti-gay--,INTERVIEWEE, --all this anti-gay stuff. And I also believe that people in the room they weren't really anti-gay they were pro votes you know? So it's like they can't go -- they have to say what the voters out there will accept to get the votes. Yeah think what they want. So you have to say that.,INTERVIEWER, Well what do you think goes through Kenny Mehlman though? What do you think just go through him?,INTERVIEWEE, He probably took so many you know like those showers that like rape victims take you know at the end of the day in the shower just scrubbing himself. He probably had a lot of those type of showers.,INTERVIEWER, How did you come out?,INTERVIEWEE, How did I come out? I did it in Vegas. Las Vegas. Yeah. Las Vegas.,INTERVIEWER, As an adult?,INTERVIEWEE, I mean publicly.,INTERVIEWER, You were on stage?,INTERVIEWEE, It was after one of the -- it was a Prop 8 rally. It was the national day after the -- after Prop 8 passed. And I was in Vegas. I was performing at Planet Hollywood. And I said okay where's the rally in Vegas? We're going to go. And so it's a group of us. And you know I had no intentions on speaking at the rally. I had you know I was just there in support. And so at the end of the -- end of the speeches they said we understand that there's you know someone out there in the audience. And they--,INTERVIEWER, Come on down?,INTERVIEWEE, --they will -- yeah come on down. And to say a few things we appreciate you hear supporting us. So when I got up there I'm like I'm not just supporting you know you. I'm supporting me. So it just you know. But you know I guess that phrase whatever happens in Vegas stays in Vegas not true Larry not true Larry King.,INTERVIEWER, When did you know Wanda that you were a lesbian?,INTERVIEWEE, When did I know? Let me see. When did "Coffy" come out? Pam Greer. "Coffy." No.,INTERVIEWER, No like I mean is there a period you're in high school and you're --,INTERVIEWEE, It was -- you know it was very early on. I remember I was in the -- I mean maybe second or third grade. And--,INTERVIEWER, Really?,INTERVIEWEE, --it was these two sisters. And they both liked my brother. I have an older brother. They both liked him. And my brother was off with one of the sisters. And you know walking around whatever. It's like fourth of July fireworks or something. So I was stuck with the other sister. And you know 'cause she was walking around with me trying to find my brother and her sister.,INTERVIEWER, Wait you're in third grade?,INTERVIEWEE, I'm like in third grade right. And she's holding my hand. We're walking. I'm look up at her. And I told her I said you know I wish I were a boy because then you could be my girlfriend. And the look she gave me like huh-uh don't ever--,INTERVIEWER, Don't go there.,INTERVIEWEE, Don't ever say that again. Because I think she saw that it wasn't like you know--,INTERVIEWER, Right.,INTERVIEWEE, -- some like childhood -- you know just like a little girl saying something. I think she saw I was putting the moves on her. And it scared her. She couldn't handle it.,INTERVIEWER, Did it ever scare you?,INTERVIEWEE, Did it ever scare me?,INTERVIEWER, Yes approaching the world where you're going to be different.,INTERVIEWEE, Oh of course I have parents who are still alive. So yeah I mean you know and that's why you suppress all that you bury it and to try to fit in. I'm 46. I mean you know. So back then you know you know religion everything else--,INTERVIEWER, I know.,INTERVIEWEE, You know we didn't -- we weren't exposed to gay people.,INTERVIEWER, And your father's in the service.,INTERVIEWEE, My father's in the service. Right retired colonel. So--,INTERVIEWER, How did you tell them?, INTERVIEWEE, A long distance phone call.,INTERVIEWER, Long distance?,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah we're talking like coast to coast.,INTERVIEWER, How did they handle it?,INTERVIEWEE, You always want to give your family like a six-hour plane ride before they can get to you.,INTERVIEWER, Did they handle it all right?,INTERVIEWEE, We're working on it.,INTERVIEWER, Still?,INTERVIEWEE, They love me. Yes yes. I mean they love me. I know without a doubt my family they love me. And you know we're -- you know we're working on it. Keep praying for us.,INTERVIEWER, More with Wanda Sykes. We'll talk about Prop 8. More on that subject and other things your calls and Twitter. You Twitter?,INTERVIEWEE, I dabble.,INTERVIEWER, You do -- write all your own stuff right?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes yes.,INTERVIEWER, What do you think of the president the job he's doing? His approval rating is down. What do you think?,INTERVIEWEE, I think it's time for the First Lady to start doing some of this really. It's about time. I mean maybe she needs to get out of her herb garden a little bit you know and start smashing some heads you know? I think he's doing a really good job. I mean you look at it like this. Look at where we were you know what -- the mess that this country was left in when Bush left. So he comes in and it's like basically people expecting him you know to fix everything. That's like handing him a spoon and telling him to go fill in the Grand Canyon you know? We were deep deep deep in debt. Our economy's a mess. And look at what he's done. Our troops are -- the combat troops are coming out of Iraq. We have -- he passed the health care bill. He's going to end don't ask don't tell.,INTERVIEWER, Yeah when is he going to do that?,INTERVIEWEE, Well he's letting the military which I think is a good idea work it out. He's coming up with the plan. I mean that's what I like about him. He's not just going to say I want this ended and they just -- and tomorrow they wake up and they have to figure out how to do it you know or it's done. At least he's not ramming it down you know down your throats which I guess you really shouldn't use ramming it down your throat when we're talking about don't ask don't tell. But--,INTERVIEWER, What does your father think about don't ask don't tell?,INTERVIEWEE, What does my father think? My father -- and I hope I'm not stepping out of line here but I remember having a discussion with him. And he said there's been gays in the military for years. There was gays in the military when he was there. And you know when you're in the trenches whatever with the guy next to you or woman next to you whatever--,INTERVIEWER, You ain't thinking about kissing them?,INTERVIEWEE, You ain't thinking about that. You know you're thinking about how to get home.,INTERVIEWER, All right. What do you make of the fact that apparently 24 percent of Americans believe that Obama is a Muslim?,INTERVIEWEE, Okay. People are just dumb basically. And they believe anything and everything. That someone sits on the television or on their radio and you say it they think it is true. They think it is fact. They take it as fact. When you -- all this stuff on the Internet it's just crazy what people believe. You know? It's out of control.,INTERVIEWER, First president to issue a press release saying he's a Christian.,INTERVIEWEE, Why? You know it's nuts that it had to go that far. It really is insane. There's people just sitting in their little basements with their little crazy hats with the little propellers on there just typing nonsense. And people believe it. They just get a little you know a little piece of information. And they run with that. I really wish we could get back to some really good journalists you know and just real facts. Remember when you read the paper and if they made a mistake they would come back and print a little retraction and say oh we messed up? There's none of that. There's none of that now. You don't have any you know any checks or--,INTERVIEWER, Like weatherman they never say when they were wrong.,INTERVIEWEE, Never yeah.,INTERVIEWER, You notice that? Yes.,INTERVIEWEE, Exactly.,INTERVIEWER, The weatherman ever come on television and say I was wrong yesterday about the rain. They never do that. Our guest is Wanda Sykes. She's terrific. She's nominated for an Emmy. The Emmys are on this Sunday night. And Jimmy Fallon will be here tomorrow. And he's going to host it. She's talked about President Obama. What does she think about former Governor Sarah Palin? More with Wanda Sykes next.,INTERVIEWEE, So you automatically think the black man is the valet?,INTERVIEWER, No I don't automatically.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes you did. I saw it.,INTERVIEWER, You're standing by the valet.,INTERVIEWEE, Get my car boy. I saw it Larry.,INTERVIEWER, Yeah he had on a white shirt and a vest. He's standing by the valet. It's an honest mistake.,INTERVIEWEE, Oh yes that's honest anytime I see a black man in a tie and a suit I think hey you must park cars for a living.,INTERVIEWER, I feel like it was a honest mistake Wanda.,INTERVIEWEE, No no. If it was a white man standing here--,INTERVIEWER, I would have given him the -- I would too.,INTERVIEWEE, No you would have--,INTERVIEWER, I would too have.,INTERVIEWEE, No you would have--,INTERVIEWER, Too.,INTERVIEWEE, You would have asked him -- not.,INTERVIEWER, She'll be back on this next season of "Curb your Enthusiasm" filmed mostly in New York. And that's one of the great scenes in that great show's history. They let you ad-lib right?,INTERVIEWEE, Oh it's all ad-libbed. Yes.,INTERVIEWER, They just give you an outline?,INTERVIEWEE, You know--,INTERVIEWER, Like you would come up and complain about what he was doing giving his parking ticket to a guy waiting for his car--,INTERVIEWEE, Right.,INTERVIEWER, --because he was black?,INTERVIEWEE, Exactly. It's -- that's basically what he gives you. It's like okay you walk out the restaurant you see me I'm handing my valet ticket to a black guy but he's not the valley. Okay I got it. And then we just go with it.,INTERVIEWER, He's brilliant.,INTERVIEWEE, He's brilliant. He is. He's brilliant but it's like the most stressful gig that I do.,INTERVIEWER, Why?,INTERVIEWEE, Because you don't know. You don't have any lines you know. And when I first got the call I'm like oh good I'm going to work with Larry David. Oh he's a genius great writer. And I get to have all these funny Larry David words and maybe there will be some "Seinfeld-isms." You know some -- and you get there and it's like where's my script? Oh no just make it up. What kind of lazy piece of crap is this? I want a damn script. No but it's stressful because like you said his level of where he works you just--,INTERVIEWER, Well it doesn't come out that way. And he's brilliant.,INTERVIEWEE, Thank you.,INTERVIEWER, All right what's your take on Sarah Palin? Should we take her seriously?,INTERVIEWEE, Well you have to take her seriously because there are people out there who listen to her. I think she is -- she's smart in the way that she's an opportunist but she's not smart enough to pull it off. Because if -- all you got to do just give her enough rope and she's going to say something stupid. You know she's making up words. You know just give her enough room and she's going to blow it. That's all you need. If she operates in just a little small stage and just knows when -- just like to shut up. Like if somebody just put an ear piece in her ear and just said period and just tell her you know stop she will go far. But she doesn't know how to stop. So--,INTERVIEWER, There's a likability quality too though isn't there? I mean she's very attractive? She's--,INTERVIEWEE, Well she says the things that are you know that the people in that little area want to hear. I mean there's a group who feel very connected to her. And she--,INTERVIEWER, They sure do.,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah right. And you have to give her credit for that. But when you listen to it you know really a lot of it doesn't make any sense. I mean--,INTERVIEWER, What do you make of Levi Johnston Sarah Palin's former future son-in-law who has gone back then not back? He's running for mayor?,INTERVIEWEE, Okay so so let me get this right because he was let's say in the family so does that make him what somehow just by that connection now he's qualified to run a city? I mean I don't understand. Just because you know okay I'm around them so all of her brilliance is going to rub off on him. What? He's a baby daddy.,INTERVIEWER, A baby daddy?,INTERVIEWEE, He's a baby daddy. They weren't married. You know I don't -- it's the most craziest thing I've ever heard. Baby daddy. Man baby daddy.,INTERVIEWER, What do you make of Dr. Laura?,INTERVIEWEE, Dr. Laura?,INTERVIEWER, She quit her radio show right where you're sitting. That's where she announced she was quitting.,INTERVIEWEE, That's -- this is where she announced?,INTERVIEWER, Right where you're sitting.,INTERVIEWEE, Well here's the shocking thing about Dr. Laura Larry. I did not know that black people actually listened to Dr. Laura.,INTERVIEWER, Yes it was a black lady caller.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes a black lady called in. I didn't know that black people ever call heard show or even listened to her show.,INTERVIEWER, Why not? Why?,INTERVIEWEE, Black people don't listen to Dr. Laura. That's a white people thing. That's a white people thing.,INTERVIEWER, You mean black people don't need psychological help or they don't have marital problems?,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah but we're not going to call Dr. Laura. We're not calling -- Dr. Laura's not even a psychologist. She's not a psychiatrist.,INTERVIEWER, I think she--,INTERVIEWEE, No she's a physiologist. Her background is--,INTERVIEWER, Oh.,INTERVIEWEE, --so you make better time getting therapy from your masseuse. I mean really. Dr. Laura? I mean and I think Dr. Laura was shocked. And she was really like really ticked off that this black woman called into her show. I think that's why she went off. She was like wait a minute you mean to tell me all these years I've been giving free advice to a bunch of -- you know. So she just went off. These -- calling my show. I think that's why she--,INTERVIEWER, Well she says that black comedians use the "N" word.,INTERVIEWEE, What does that have to do with anything? This woman is calling for advice on her you know on her marriage. She's not calling on notes for an HBO special. Why -- it didn't make any sense at all. I mean I think Dr. Laura was -- she's probably been saying the "N" word for years but it's the first time a black person was actually listening to her show. I mean really I've been black Larry for 46 years. And my entire 46 years I've never heard one of my black friends start a conversation with you know I was listening to Dr. Laura the other day.,INTERVIEWER, Let me get a break. We'll be right back with--,INTERVIEWEE, White people stuff Larry.,INTERVIEWER, Wanda just told us that she was beaten for an Emmy by the Kennedy Center Honors. One of the other programs up for an honor was "Hope for Haiti." What if you had beaten "Hope for Haiti.",INTERVIEWEE, Well exactly. What was I supposed to do? Take that Haiti. There's no hope for you tonight Haiti. I got your hope Haiti. Look at this.,INTERVIEWER, Let's take a call for Wanda Sykes. Port Saint Lucie Florida hello. Hi Wanda. Not only are you the best comedian you're the best comedian out there and you have the best laugh but my question stems from this.,INTERVIEWEE, Thank you.,INTERVIEWER, When President Obama was elected I was so proud that this country was progressive enough to elect a non-white elderly man. And now during this situation where he's being attacked by -- from all end the Tea Party these non-issues about the birth certificates the Muslim issue how do we cope with that? How do we fight back and get the facts out there?,INTERVIEWEE, You know thank you. And we really need to do something because I don't know if you've noticed but he's like getting gray and everything and wrinkly. He's turning into an old white man. We're like watching this happen gray hair the wrinkles.,INTERVIEWER, It will age anybody.,INTERVIEWEE, It definitely -- yeah the stress. I think the same energy that we had when the election was happening and we were supporting him.,INTERVIEWER, The Inaugural.,INTERVIEWEE, Inaugural yes. We have to get back to that. Right now we're kind of like just sitting back said OK we got you in office now you do your thing.,INTERVIEWER, We got another clip from Wanda's Emmy-nominated HBO special "I'm Going To Be Me." Take a look.,INTERVIEWEE, It's harder. It's harder being gay than it is being black. It is. There's some things that I have -- there's some things that I had to do as gay that I didn't have to do as black. I didn't have to come out black. I didn't have to sit my parents down and tell them about my blackness.,INTERVIEWER, You are legally married right?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes I am legally married.,INTERVIEWER, How did you meet -- I don't know how to say this -- your bride? Or your husband?,INTERVIEWEE, My lucky lady. No my wife. Yeah my bride my wife.,INTERVIEWER, She's the wife.,INTERVIEWEE, We both are wives. Or -- yeah.,INTERVIEWER, I guess you are.,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah. We don't do the role playing thing.,INTERVIEWER, How did you meet her?,INTERVIEWEE, Not my thing. You wear the pants tonight no.,INTERVIEWER, How did you meet her? Beautiful girl.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes she is. She's a looker. Come on what do you expect? You think I was going to be with an ugly woman? Look at this Larry. Look at this.,INTERVIEWER, You carry pretty good baby.,INTERVIEWEE, I carry it. That's right.,INTERVIEWER, She's French right?,INTERVIEWEE, She's French.,INTERVIEWER, Where did you meet her?,INTERVIEWEE, I met her New York Fire Island. Fire Island New York City. Outside of New York.,INTERVIEWER, Was it a party or --,INTERVIEWEE, I saw her on the ferry ride on the way over to the island. And I just -- just something -- I heard something that just said hey Wanda that's what you need. And the rest is history. We are -- our paths crossed eventually on the island. And just been inseparable since.,INTERVIEWER, We got a question for you Tweeted to Kings Things. Ask Wanda how being a mom has affected you as a stand-up.,INTERVIEWEE, So much material there. So much material being a mom.,INTERVIEWER, What do you have? A little what?,INTERVIEWEE, Twins a little boy and little girl.,INTERVIEWER, How old?,INTERVIEWEE, They're 15 months 15 months old.,INTERVIEWER, Who gave birth?,INTERVIEWEE, She did. Oh there's nothing coming out of here Larry. That wouldn't be pretty.,INTERVIEWER, Were you at the birth?,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah I was there. I was there.,INTERVIEWER, So what's their names?,INTERVIEWEE, Olivia Lou and Lucas Claude. What do you expect? Hakeem and Shaquika or something?,INTERVIEWER, Not Jewish either Olivia and Lucas?,INTERVIEWEE, No not Jewish.,INTERVIEWER, So what's it like? What's being a mother like?,INTERVIEWEE, I love it. I love it. Every day there's something new. And -- but it's always -- it's something new but you -- it always goes back to "get that out of your mouth" or "don't put that in your mouth" or "what does he have in his mouth?" Everything just goes --,INTERVIEWER, When you talk about this -- here's a clip from the special. Watch.,INTERVIEWEE, And I don't understand how people cheat you know especially when they have new kids and they cheat. Where the (EXPLETIVE DELETED) do you get the energy to cheat? (EXPLETIVE DELETED) I told my wife. I said look if you ever catch me in another woman's bed you know I'm just there for a nap.,INTERVIEWER, That is funny stuff.,INTERVIEWEE, It's true.,INTERVIEWER, You want to have more kids?,INTERVIEWEE, You know I -- we talked about it. And you know we'll see. We'll see. I just told her I am not changing a diaper when I get 50. That's it. So if you're going to do it that's you know --,INTERVIEWER, How did you pick the donor?,INTERVIEWEE, How did we pick the donor? We said -- we wanted like -- it's more about like height and good health basically. And --,INTERVIEWER, Did they tell you the who the donor is?,INTERVIEWEE, Oh no no no no. God forbid if it turns out to be Mel Gibson's babies. I'm in trouble Larry. What am I going to do? That's it. Oh Mel I hope you didn't drop a load anywhere. Please tell me you didn't donate something.,INTERVIEWER, You think you went a little too far there?,INTERVIEWEE, Not at all. Not at all.,INTERVIEWER, There's no connect here right between here and you right?,INTERVIEWEE, Probably not. It might be a little speed bump you know just a little one.,INTERVIEWER, Have you heard from Rush Limbaugh fans since then?,INTERVIEWEE, I did get a nasty note. But you know who cares you know? Who cares? You know here's the problem: Rush Limbaugh is a filthy rich guy. And he's playing on the emotions of poor people. He's telling poor people that hey you know Obama's going to take this take that away from you. And really he's just worried about his own pockets. That's it. He's just a big bully. I don't think I went too far at all.,INTERVIEWER, Port Saint Lucie Florida. Hello. Hi Wanda. Thanks for taking my call Larry. Wanda what are your thoughts about Wood's newest comments today in "People Magazine" that she's been through hell?,INTERVIEWEE, I'm sorry what was that again?,INTERVIEWER, Oh Elin Woods who just divorced Tiger. "People Magazine" comes out tomorrow. She gave them the exclusive interview and she said she felt she was blind sided.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, What did you make of Tiger?,INTERVIEWEE, Tiger man he never should have gotten married. He knew he liked to play around. He likes the ladies. He should have just -- you know just stayed -- be a Playboy. It would have been -- he would have been the hugest rock star ever you know the golfer the jet- setter. You know women all on the planes and everything you know? But he tried to do the married thing had the kids. And as far as Elin I mean I'm sure she was blind sided. But I'm sure that big bag of money is going to you know just cushion that blow and she's going to -- she's getting a big bag of money. Good for her.,INTERVIEWER, She still was hurting. She's got two little children.,INTERVIEWEE, Sometimes I get a headache I rub a 100 dollar bill up here. And oh oh I call my business manager. I'm like I don't feel -- my stomach aches. He'll say OK we just got a check in. Oh that feels better. How many zeros? Oh yeah yeah yeah. Healed. I feel better.,INTERVIEWER, We have a --,INTERVIEWEE, Time heals all wounds. Huh-uh. Money baby. Money. Money will --,INTERVIEWER, We have a Tweet to King's Things. They want to ask Wanda what she thinks of the Jetblue flight attendant who is now an American hero.,INTERVIEWEE, Oh now. You want to ask me that?,INTERVIEWER, Twitter twitter.,INTERVIEWEE, Good for him.,INTERVIEWER, You like what he did?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes. He just went off. I've been on flights where I've wanted to jump up and smack people. You know?,INTERVIEWER, You weren't even a flight attendant. ,INTERVIEWEE, Not even a flight attendant. I've seen behavior on flights. We just flew back from France with the two kids. And I wanted to jump off the plane you know? So -- and I'm related to them. You know. So I -- you know I think everybody's had that moment where you're on your job and you just want to go off and tell people where to go and just lose it.,INTERVIEWER, Going down the chute?,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah oh that's the way to do it. That's the way. At least we know they work you know?,INTERVIEWER, Good point.,INTERVIEWEE, Jetblue you want to make sure. Hey OK we have chutes. Jetblue should -- they should use that as a campaign ad. They should do that. Hey we got chutes.,INTERVIEWER, They could show it. Yeah. You ought to do commercials for them.,INTERVIEWEE, Right.,INTERVIEWER, Wanda Sykes we have this Tweeted to King's Things. Ask Wanda about working for the NSA the National Security Agency. You?,INTERVIEWEE, I worked for the NSA yes. Top secret clearance all that stuff.,INTERVIEWER, Doing what?,INTERVIEWEE, I have a degree in marketing so I was a procurement specialist. Basically I shopped all day. Just bought things.,INTERVIEWER, What did you procure?,INTERVIEWEE, Anything from like office furniture to like you know intel equipment.,INTERVIEWER, What do they do at the NSA?,INTERVIEWEE, Basically they collect intelligence. Yeah. They didn't get much from me. You know.,INTERVIEWER, Adjacent to the CIA?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes CIA they're more with people you know. Yeah. And NSA is more with --,INTERVIEWER, NSA is equipment. ,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah.,INTERVIEWER, And you were a procurement officer. It sounds raunchy. Anyway --,INTERVIEWEE, Raunchy? I wasn't buying hookers.,INTERVIEWER, I don't know what you procure. In another Tweet.,INTERVIEWEE, I was a pimp. Yeah Larry.,INTERVIEWER, What are your hopes for Prop 8 reaching the Supreme Court? And what -- you think eventually we're going to have gay marriage in America?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes I do. I mean I did -- the team we have you know fighting it now Mr. Olson it's -- I think we're very close to getting to the Supreme Court. And I believe that it will -- Prop 8 will be defeated and that we will have gay marriage across the country. Because it's in the Constitution. I mean not gay marriage but equality. You know you can't have discrimination. And everything that has -- you know that was wrong and happened in history has been changed by going through the courts.,INTERVIEWER, Don't you -- do you understand the other side of the issue though how people --,INTERVIEWEE, I can understand it. But I think they're wrong. I get it. That's why we have a separation of church and state. You can't have the constitution and your Bible. There's a separation. So I believe everyone should be able to have their religious beliefs you know and live by that if that's what you want to do. But keep it away from the Constitution and what it's saying that we all are equal.,INTERVIEWER, How did it feel to get married?,INTERVIEWEE, It felt great. It felt great.,INTERVIEWER, Where did you get married?,INTERVIEWEE, We got married in Palm Springs. Just had a big hot tub. It was crazy Larry. We had champagne -- no. You're getting excited weren't you. You were like hmm. It was like -- it was really spiritual and we had like just a nice weekend and like 40 of our you know like closest friends and family. It was fun.,INTERVIEWER, Do you speak French?,INTERVIEWEE, Un petit peur just a lit bit . I have to. My wife speaks French to the kids. So I have to learn French. I don't want them ganging up on me. Right now I just listen for anything that says noir. If it says noir I know that's black. I go hey what are you talking about black for? What's -- so I have to stay on top of it. The kids will be bilingual hopefully trilingual because our nanny speaks Spanish. ,INTERVIEWER, So you're going to have all three going?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, Wanda you're a sensational act. You're a tremendous performer.,INTERVIEWEE, Why thank you. Thank you.,INTERVIEWER, Thank you for being with us.,INTERVIEWEE, I'm so honored to be here.,INTERVIEWER, My honor.,INTERVIEWEE, I telling you this makes my career here.,INTERVIEWER, I hope you win.,INTERVIEWEE, Sitting across from you.,INTERVIEWER, Sunday night. Jimmy Fallon will be here tomorrow.,INTERVIEWEE, OK. Put a good word in for me.,INTERVIEWER, You'll be there right?,INTERVIEWEE, I will be there.,INTERVIEWER, I hope they have the camera right on you.,INTERVIEWEE, I want to wear a mouthpiece this time. So that way I'll be ready for when they punch me in the face.,INTERVIEWER, Oh you're here.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes that's...,INTERVIEWER, Oh this is -- this is kind of kinky.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes it's kinky. Exactly.,INTERVIEWER, Tyra Banks shows and tells.,INTERVIEWEE, I'm over my last name. I...,INTERVIEWER, So what are you now Tyra? ,INTERVIEWEE, Just Tyra.,INTERVIEWER, Yes.,INTERVIEWEE, Just call me Tyra.,INTERVIEWER, Next on LARRY KING LIVE. Good evening. What a pleasure to welcome her back -- Tyra Banks. Whoa. Since this show she's become major. She appeared here in January of 2007 and look what's happened to her since -- host of "The Tyra Show;" creator/executive producer and host of "America's Next Top Model" which airs Wednesday nights on the CW no less; and recently launched an online magazine called "TYRA: Beauty Inside and Out." Are you looking to be Oprah? Is that it?,INTERVIEWEE, Am I looking to be Oprah? Oh Lord if I tried I would fail.,INTERVIEWER, But you're approaching it -- magazines shows specials.,INTERVIEWEE, She is like the -- the Godmama you know. I -- there will never be another. There never has been there never will be another. But looking to be her -- no. I mean I -- I started as a model. So there's a path that's quite different.,INTERVIEWER, Yes. OK. You said it.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes but I mean I bow down to her.,INTERVIEWER, The last time you were on we were dealing with the "F" word meaning fat.,INTERVIEWEE, Oh I was like...,INTERVIEWER, You were fighting back against...,INTERVIEWEE, ...hilarious.,INTERVIEWER, ...an unflattering tabloid photo of you remember in the swimsuit?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, You've lost weight since then.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, Do you still feel an image pressure?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, Do you think -- you think like a fat person?,INTERVIEWEE, I -- I don't actually. You know when I -- when I told the world to kiss my fat -- I can say "ass" right?,INTERVIEWER, Yes you can.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes. When I told the world to kiss my fat ass I remained that size for two years. I maintained it with my ice cream and my salad with ranch dressing and croutons and bacon bits. Like I -- I didn't look at myself -- even on television -- and think that I was too big or I don't know. I didn't -- it didn't connect. But since I have lost a lot of weight. And it started with the -- a weight loss challenge actually at the top of this year. So I'm two years after kiss my fat ass.,INTERVIEWER, But as you described croutons ranch dressing...,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, You sounded like you missed it.,INTERVIEWEE, I love it.,INTERVIEWER, Aha.,INTERVIEWEE, I love...,INTERVIEWER, Do you make substitutes?,INTERVIEWEE, ... Food. Yes. I mean I still have my Caesar salad I just do it with some balsamic vinaigrette and extra parmesan cheese maybe so much where they're like do you want a little bit of lettuce with your parmesan cheese salad Tyra? But I -- I did this challenge with my friends. There was about eight of us from "America's Next Top Model" some past talk show people and some friends. And we were sitting around a table and kind of trash talking and decided to do this challenge because we're -- we all love food. And I trash talked so much where I had to win. And I did.,INTERVIEWER, When you look in the mirror are you happy with the way you look?,INTERVIEWEE, I've -- OK I might be doing a little TMI -- do you know what TMI is? Too much information. I always feel...,INTERVIEWER, Well give it to me anyway.,INTERVIEWEE, I always feel great when I don't have clothes on. So at home by myself walking past...,INTERVIEWER, I'm imagining that now.,INTERVIEWEE, It's too much information.,INTERVIEWER, OK. Got it. Yes.,INTERVIEWEE, But I always feel good that way.,INTERVIEWER, So you don't look at yourself nude and say oh I don't like this?,INTERVIEWEE, No...,INTERVIEWER, You like it?,INTERVIEWEE, ...unless the lighting is bad in a dressing room.,INTERVIEWER, OK.,INTERVIEWEE, But no. I -- I always feel good. But sometimes certain clothes when I put them on and they don't fit the way that I would like them to that's when I tend to get self-conscious.,INTERVIEWER, Would you say you're a particular person?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes but not with my physical image.,INTERVIEWER, OK.,INTERVIEWEE, Particularly with my work.,INTERVIEWER, All right. You kicked off season five of your talk show by revealing your real hair. Let's watch this.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, All right. Let's watch.,INTERVIEWEE, Let's talk about my hair right now. I know it's been a big mystery. And I was like it was an unsolved mystery. And I felt like I needed to solve this mystery. Like I've worn weaves and wigs and pieces and clip-ons and clip-outs and clip-downs and arounds since I was 17 18 years old. And I wanted to show the real me. I wanted to show the raw me. And I had just got out of the shower -- beat the face first of course y'all and then came out of here and came on this stage. And this is me y'all. This is me.,INTERVIEWER, How did that feel?,INTERVIEWEE, Oh my God it felt so liberating. It felt so liberating. I have worn fake hair since I was 17 years old.,INTERVIEWER, Extensions and all that...,INTERVIEWEE, Extensions weaves wigs -- I mean just everything. So to be able to be myself it just felt liberating and free. And -- but I also did it because I feel like I have a responsibility. There's so many young girls that come up to me and say Tyra I want to look just like you and I don't look like me you know when I go home...,INTERVIEWER, Is this -- is this real?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes. This is me. You want to feel my scalp?,INTERVIEWER, Yes.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes? It's a little kinky in the scalp. That's like real black girl hair.,INTERVIEWER, That's black girl hair.,INTERVIEWEE, But -- go -- go in there.,INTERVIEWER, Oh yes yes.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes. That's...,INTERVIEWER, Oh this is -- this is kind of kinky. It's kind of kinky.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes it's kinky. Exactly. My natural hair texture is very kinky.,INTERVIEWER, By the way is bad hair different for black women than white women?,INTERVIEWEE, A bad hair day?,INTERVIEWER, Yes.,INTERVIEWEE, For black women? You know hair...,INTERVIEWER, Because the hair is different right?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes the texture is very different...,INTERVIEWER, Yes.,INTERVIEWEE, As you saw.,INTERVIEWER, Sure. It is.,INTERVIEWEE, You felt my real hair texture.,INTERVIEWER, Yes.,INTERVIEWEE, This is straightened. This part is straightened. This part is not inside. But I mean hair for black women we spend $9 billion a year on hair products -- black women do. And you know so growing up as a young girl and seeing images in the media where they're saying that a certain type of hair is beautiful and yours isn't is very difficult for a black woman -- for black women. And it's a -- it's a long political thing that we can do a whole show about. But I felt it was my responsibility to show as much of my real hair as possible. Now my natural texture is a lot kinkier but it's chemically straightened.,INTERVIEWER, Black men too right?,INTERVIEWEE, Black men and hair?,INTERVIEWER, Black men used to change their hair a lot try to...,INTERVIEWEE, Oh that's like the '40s and '50s...,INTERVIEWER, Years ago yes.,INTERVIEWEE, ...like the conk and Malcolm X and all that.,INTERVIEWER, Yes.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes but black men tend to like it pretty natural now. The Jheri curl is dead.,INTERVIEWER, Does it feel better to be natural?,INTERVIEWEE, It feels better to be natural but it -- I'll have to admit it is hard to upkeep it. Like you know when I work out -- when I wear wigs and weaves I work out and you know you just wash it really fast and you keep -- you go because you're putting fake on top of the real. With my real hair I mean I -- I -- for years I forgot why black women were running from the rain. Like why are you all running I don't understand because I had wigs and weaves. Now it rains I run.,INTERVIEWER, How do you look at you now? I mean with all that's happened to you do you kind of pinch yourself?,INTERVIEWEE, I -- I'm starting to learn to celebrate success. Like for...,INTERVIEWER, You should.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes. I'm -- I'm learning that because I'm -- I'm very driven. Like you know whenever I see like a young girl that has issue or an insecurity or something I'm like oh God I've got to tackle that now I've got to do that. So I'm always like pushing pushing pushing pushing. But I had to realize to stop take a vacation go to dinner go to the movies like enjoy my success. So I'm...,INTERVIEWER, Do you like celebrity? Do you like being a celebrity?,INTERVIEWEE, The one thing I like about being a celebrity more than anything is being able to get into any restaurant I want. That is...,INTERVIEWER, That's the best.,INTERVIEWEE, That is the best.,INTERVIEWER, And the table ain't by the kitchen.,INTERVIEWEE, Oh it ain't by the kitchen. It -- you know what I don't like about celebrity is people quote us higher Larry. You know if this cup doesn't really have a price tag on it they see Larry King and Tyra Banks coming this cup is now $10 when it's really worth $2.50.,INTERVIEWER, We're back with Tyra Banks who's -- who's everywhere doing everything. In July "Forbes" magazine ranked you as the fifth most influential woman in the media behind Oprah Diane Sawyer Barbara Walters and Ellen DeGeneres.,INTERVIEWEE, My mama sent me that article.,INTERVIEWER, Do you want to be number one?,INTERVIEWEE, Oh gosh I don't think it's possible.,INTERVIEWER, Did it flatter you?,INTERVIEWEE, Heck yes it did. Yes. My mom sent this to me and she says oh my God look at this. I still find it a little odd though. It -- but it's very flattering but odd. It's...,INTERVIEWER, How does mom feel?,INTERVIEWEE, My mama is so proud.,INTERVIEWER, Yes.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes. I -- I can always tell when she's tearing up. And when she sent that to me I know that she was tearing up.,INTERVIEWER, And in fact even "The New York Times Magazine" branded you as the next big female-branded self. Have you become -- you don't need your last name anymore right?,INTERVIEWEE, I'm over my last name.,INTERVIEWER, That's when you made it. All you've got to do is say Tyra.,INTERVIEWEE, I'm -- I -- I don't -- I -- you know as a model I was Tyra Banks my -- my given name that my parents named me. And then after a while we decided as a model to drop the Banks because that was the cool thing to do -- Veruschka Iman you know all the big models had just that one name. And then I decided to use my last name again. And now I'm over it. I -- I -- I...,INTERVIEWER, So what are you now Tyra or...?,INTERVIEWEE, Just Tyra.,INTERVIEWER, Yes.,INTERVIEWEE, Just call me Tyra.,INTERVIEWER, What is your brand do you think? When you merge into so many things...,INTERVIEWEE, Yes...,INTERVIEWER, ...who are you?,INTERVIEWEE, I -- you know what I you know had a long time to really think about that and to really go into what my core values are. And my passion is really dealing with women -- young women and women in general. And I finally figured out that my brand is beauty inside and out. And it's inside and outside. To just say oh we're only going to focus on the inside is not realistic when it comes to young girls because their physical self is so important to them -- so so important. And just to focus on the outside wouldn't be like dealing with who I am in my core. So I think -- I really think it's beauty inside.,INTERVIEWER, Is there a down side to being beautiful?,INTERVIEWEE, Ah -- is there a downside to...,INTERVIEWER, Well for example... ,INTERVIEWEE, Are you calling me beautiful?,INTERVIEWER, ...you're single.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, Some men feel they can't approach you.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, Or I can't ask Tyra out on a date.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes that -- that happens. But the ones that do you know either they are very cocky or very confident. Yes.,INTERVIEWER, But you're not alone on Saturday nights?,INTERVIEWEE, Am I alone on Saturday nights? I don't know.,INTERVIEWER, I don't think so.,INTERVIEWEE, You don't think so?,INTERVIEWER, You were cast as the first lady in a layout in the September's "Harper's Bazaar.",INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, What do you...,INTERVIEWEE, Last year.,INTERVIEWER, ...what do you think about Michelle Obama?,INTERVIEWEE, Oh my gosh when -- do you remember when she delivered her speech?,INTERVIEWER, Sure.,INTERVIEWEE, It was amazing. And I just sat there and I teared up. And I called my mom and I said mom no offense but Oprah Winfrey is my role model you're my role model and I have a new one. I find her to be the epitome of elegance of class and of...,INTERVIEWER, She sat in that chair three times.,INTERVIEWEE, She did?,INTERVIEWER, And every time she makes an impression on me.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, You cannot not... ,INTERVIEWEE, She is so...,INTERVIEWER, ...think highly of her.,INTERVIEWEE, ...so impressive.,INTERVIEWER, Yes.,INTERVIEWEE, An amazing mother protects her children like you know like you know do you -- you know they didn't ask for this. They just so happened to be the first children of our country. I -- I find her absolutely amazing.,INTERVIEWER, I learned a few weeks ago that she only works two days a week.,INTERVIEWEE, Really?,INTERVIEWER, The other five are the kids' days.,INTERVIEWEE, Wow. Yes.,INTERVIEWER, She's a mother first.,INTERVIEWEE, She's a momma. And I love that about her. And her hair is fantastic.,INTERVIEWER, Oh yeah. That real hair right?,INTERVIEWEE, It's real hair. Yes she wears her real hair. But if she wants to rock a weave Larry who cares? She doesn't but if she does who cares?,INTERVIEWER, What about the way she dresses?,INTERVIEWEE, I love it. I love the fact that she pushes the envelope on what the narrow box is of what a first lady is supposed to look like. That's what I'm all about -- redefining beauty breaking stereotypes being your own person being your unique individual.,INTERVIEWER, So you kind of thread a line. What did you make of Jimmy Carter's recent remark that part of the reason for this anger at the president is racist?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes. I you know honestly have not seen it. But I have read a lot of what has been going on recently. And I have to kind of go with what our president says. You know he says in terms of health care there's -- you know it's very volatile. You know certain people believe this certain people believe that. And a lot of things maybe can get misconstrued or a lot of things -- I don't know. I have to really defer to him on that because I think he. ,INTERVIEWER, But based on heritage did you ever feel in your life looked down upon because of your color?,INTERVIEWEE, Most definitely.,INTERVIEWER, So you...,INTERVIEWEE, That's just the state of where we are at right now.,INTERVIEWER, You have to carry that with you.,INTERVIEWEE, Most definitely. But it makes me stronger. It makes me stronger. And it makes me open up my arms with love as opposed to feeling angry about it.,INTERVIEWER, You faced it in modeling didn't you?,INTERVIEWEE, Most definitely. Every single day of my modeling career I was told I couldn't get a job or do certain things because of the color of my skin.,INTERVIEWER, Unbelievable.,INTERVIEWEE, Every single day. Even as one of the top supermodels of the world I heard that.,INTERVIEWER, You were the first black on "Sports Illustrated's" cover right?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes. And Victoria's Secret and a bunch of other stuff.,INTERVIEWER, You're the Jackie Robinson of female modeling.,INTERVIEWEE, Oh am I? OK.,INTERVIEWER, I hope -- I hereby declare it.,INTERVIEWEE, OK.,INTERVIEWER, We're back with the terrifically talented Tyra Banks. "The Tyra Show" is now in its fifth season. It's earned two daytime Emmys for outstanding informative talk show. Here are some of Tyra's more memorable moments. Watch.,INTERVIEWEE, It looks like me but I can't really feel it. My name is Tyra Banks.,INTERVIEWER, By the way do you like being on CW...,INTERVIEWEE, I love...,INTERVIEWER, ...rather than syndicated?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes. Well the talk show has now moved to the CW...,INTERVIEWER, I know.,INTERVIEWEE, ... Which is the same network as "Top Model." And it -- I love it because it's like all one big happy family.,INTERVIEWER, And it gets a low demographic -- a demographic of young people right?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes. And our ratings are huge right now with the talk show. Like we're number two 18 to 34 which is our demographic for the talk show. Women that are younger and older watch the show of course. But -- so our advertisers are very happy.,INTERVIEWER, Congratulations.,INTERVIEWEE, Thank you.,INTERVIEWER, A program reminder. Michael Moore tomorrow night. Michael Moore a special guest tomorrow night. And our special guest now is Tyra Banks. When singer Chris Brown was accused of beating up his then girlfriend Rihanna earlier this year a lot of people recalled an interview he had done with you. Chris was our guest earlier this month. We played a clip from that interview and asked him about it. Watch and then we'll get -- give me your reaction. Watch.,INTERVIEWEE, OK.,INTERVIEWER, What happened?,INTERVIEWEE, I made a mistake. I made a mistake in my -- and it's just something that I have to live up to and -- and own and just know that -- know that I can change and be a better person. But I -- I definitely made a mistake.,INTERVIEWER, What's your read on that whole story?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes. First it was very shocking when I first heard that it happened. You know and there are so many rumors in the entertainment industry. And I was like oh that's just a rumor. And then more and more you know police evidence and things come out and photos and things. And I just was like in shock. For -- for a moment I was in shock. And then I went back to the interview that I had with Chris Brown. And he told me that he experienced this abuse of -- of not his father but I think it was -- I think it was a father figure. I'm not sure but not his biological father -- on his mother. And that he was so scared you know hearing his mother scream and in so much pain...,INTERVIEWER, And he heard things.,INTERVIEWEE, And he heard it.,INTERVIEWER, He didn't see her hit.,INTERVIEWEE, He didn't see it but he would always hear it. And he was so terrified that he said that he would wet his bed. And he became a -- a bed-wetter for a long time -- an embarrassingly long time. And he admitted that to me. So when I heard that I said wow the cycle is repeating. That's the first thing I thought.,INTERVIEWER, So do you feel sorry for him angry at him?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, What?,INTERVIEWEE, Both. You know I feel sorry for him because we all know when I've had -- you know I've covered domestic avi -- domestic violence especially with teens on my talk show. And we do know that it is a cycle. You know when you experience something there is a large chance that you are going to become the perpetrator. So that is where the sympathy goes out because he is a victim. But at the same time your reasoning for being you know for doing something does not excuse the fate of somebody else.,INTERVIEWER, Were you shocked that a lot of his female fans blamed her?,INTERVIEWEE, There's a -- right now and in society especially with the Internet and -- there's a lot of negativity that goes on.,INTERVIEWER, Oh yes.,INTERVIEWEE, And a -- and it's -- it is such a safe place to just say craziness. You know a lot of it can be you know then maybe you know Rihanna is so beautiful and she's so fantastic and she's so lovely and she's got this great voice and this great career. You know so maybe it's easy to just go ah you know it's your fault. But I don't necessarily think that a lot of those girls really truly truly believe that behind their computers you know these... ,INTERVIEWER, Have you ever been physically abused?,INTERVIEWEE, No not physically but emotionally.,INTERVIEWER, Psychologically?,INTERVIEWEE, Oh most definitely.,INTERVIEWER, Verbally?,INTERVIEWEE, Most definitely.,INTERVIEWER, How did you handle that?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, I mean...,INTERVIEWEE, Dumbly.,INTERVIEWER, ... Some would think a beautiful girl like you is going to take abuse?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes. Yes.,INTERVIEWER, You took abuse?,INTERVIEWEE, Oh most definitely for years. You know the abuser is -- is a person...,INTERVIEWER, From a boyfriend like?,INTERVIEWEE, From a boyfriend. Well you know there's four different types of abuse which I teach my girls on my show -- there's sexual there's verbal there's emotional and there's physical. And I was emotionally Abu -- abused; a little verbal but a lot of emotional. And what -- you know I didn't necessarily think it was my fault even though he would constantly tell me I treat you this way because you make me treat you this way. I didn't think it was my fault but at the same time I wanted to prove to him that I was loveable enough because my self-esteem was lower at that time in my life. And I stayed for such a long time until one day I looked in the mirror and I -- out loud in his house said to myself I said Tyra what is wrong with you? Who are you? Get away from him. I said something like that to myself. It still took me months to get out but I finally did. And now I have young girls from the -- from the -- from the girls that are not famous to girls that are in the entertainment industry that come to me because I've told this story and many other stories about insecurities and things that I've had... ,INTERVIEWER, You've been stalked too right?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes. But you didn't let me finish.,INTERVIEWER, All right. Go ahead.,INTERVIEWEE, No I was saying they -- a lot of these girls they call me and like I become kind of like a big sister to these girls to go -- to help them with a lot of these different things that they're going through in the entertainment industry and not in the entertainment industry. But now what were you saying?,INTERVIEWER, Do you ever fear it could happen to you again?,INTERVIEWEE, It will never happen again.,INTERVIEWER, Never?,INTERVIEWEE, Never. Thank God it did happen because I know what it feels like. And I know the signs of me feeling less of a person and that I could be susceptible to that. An abuser always say that they're like -- like a heat-seeking missile. Like they can scan a room and know like it's like boop-boop-boop-boop-boop-boop-boop- boop-boop-boop-boop-boop. Like they know who the abuser is and they know who to go after. And the missile would go like this to me. It would never come back.,INTERVIEWER, She's everywhere Tyra Banks the executive producer and host of "America's Next Top Model" airs Wednesday nights on CW. She has recently launched an online magazine called "Tyra: Beauty Inside and Out" has her own of course talk show "The Tyra Show" that's on CW. Now you do a show with our friend Ashton Kutcher? What do you do with him?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes Ashton Kutcher and I we created a show together called "True Beauty" and we're executive producers on it. It's a show where the contestants think that they are competing to be the most outwardly beautiful person but really they're competing to be the most internally beautiful person.,INTERVIEWER, Is it on now?,INTERVIEWEE, It had a season and was very successful and it's coming back. ABC renewed it. So it's coming back.,INTERVIEWER, Not the CW?,INTERVIEWEE, No it's on ABC.,INTERVIEWER, Uh-huh. In a recent interview you said you wish you were more of a diva.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, Define diva.,INTERVIEWEE, Well I didn't say that somebody asked me was I one? And I said no I wish I was more of one. But I would never just say that quote.,INTERVIEWER, What is a diva to you?,INTERVIEWEE, Different things. I mean a diva can be a recording artist that just you know can sing her butt of and does not need any Auto-Tuning or any computerized vocal help. That commands a crowd. That brings people to their knees. And then there is also the negative connotation of it.,INTERVIEWER, Like Serena Williams was that a diva attitude or --,INTERVIEWEE, Oh gosh no that was an athlete a competitor. And it's so sad that you know Serena does something like that it's a diva and if a male athlete does something like that he's just being competitive and emotional. So it's bad.,INTERVIEWER, It is true in a recent interview you were asked if some of the negative stuff said about you might stem from jealousy. And you -- it said you sidestepped the question. Is that true?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes -- no I was asked that question that there was some negativity that was said about me from some people that I've hired in the past for one of my shows. And I asked the person that was interviewing me similar to an interview like this I asked them why they think these people were saying these things about me. And I pushed the person because I interview people for a living. And sometimes sometimes when you ask a question you have spot you know you have an opinion. So I was asking the interviewer's opinion. The interviewer said it was jealousy I didn't say that.,INTERVIEWER, Do you listen to answers? It's the key to interview,INTERVIEWEE, I do.,INTERVIEWER, Yes absolutely.,INTERVIEWEE, Oh my God Larry when I first started I would not listen to answers. I would just be thinking about my next question thinking about the next question.,INTERVIEWER, -- get lost.,INTERVIEWEE, Now I just listen. Sometimes throw away my prep.,INTERVIEWER, Do you think you intimidate people? Do you?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes I think so. I think so.,INTERVIEWER, What can you do about that?,INTERVIEWEE, Be myself. And most definitely try to pull away from as much of the image that they think that I am. I think the intimidation probably comes from my past career you know because I used to be a model and model stands for so many different things especially the type of modeling that I used to do supermodel sexy roar. And that's like a character that I used to play. It's not me at all.,INTERVIEWER, When a model is a supermodel let's say Sports Illustrated bathing suit Tyra Banks does it sell the suit rather than sell yourself?,INTERVIEWEE, As a model you are selling the outfit. And I do think that super models the reason why they're paid so much is because they move the product more. So when,INTERVIEWER, They check that they know that.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes I know that when I was on -- when I was with contract a Victoria's Secret model for 10 years that the reason why they paid me what they paid me was because I moved the product. If it was on me it would sell more than if it was on somebody else.,INTERVIEWER, So therefore the woman -- because the man looking at it would look at you in the face --,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, -- and then down to the suit. The woman --,INTERVIEWEE, Yes well 90 percent of Victoria's Secret buyers when I was there it was 90 percent female. Guys you know --,INTERVIEWER, They look at what you're wearing.,INTERVIEWEE, They look at what you're wearing yes.,INTERVIEWER, What makes a good model.,INTERVIEWEE, Larry a good model I think she needs to know how to smeyes (ph). ,INTERVIEWER, How to,INTERVIEWEE, Smeyes. You know what that is?,INTERVIEWER, No.,INTERVIEWEE, Smile with her eyes. To smile with your eyes. You have to be able to sell a magazine cover or sell that perfume or sell those clothes and it all starts with the eyes. I actually did an interview with Lynn Hirschberg from "New York Times Magazine." And she was like Tyra I hear that you know how to smile with your eyes so many different types of ways. And she coined that I can do 275. I'm not sure if I can do that many.,INTERVIEWER, Are you smiling now with your eyes?,INTERVIEWEE, No I'm not. Do you want me to do it?,INTERVIEWER, Yes.,INTERVIEWEE, Do you want me to do it to the camera?,INTERVIEWER, Yes do the camera.,INTERVIEWEE, All right so this is not smeyesing (ph) OK? It's just dead eyes. And this is smiling with your eyes.,INTERVIEWER, Do all the good models do that?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes all the good models know how to do that.,INTERVIEWER, You can't trademark that.,INTERVIEWEE, I wish I could trademark that. I could not trademark the actual image.,INTERVIEWER, Why do the eyes sell the product?,INTERVIEWEE, The eyes it's all about the window to the soul. If you're just dead like this you're not going to sell that eye makeup. But if you're like "Buy it buy it buy it buy it buy it." But it's not something that just models -- women can work this. You can get a second date by smeyesing. You can get a job by smeyesing on that job interview.,INTERVIEWER, Wait a minute. Can men smeyes?,INTERVIEWEE, Oh yes you can smeyes Larry. Will you try? No too intense. Soften it. Soften it. Yes yes yes. Not with the lips. Only with the eyes. Novocaine mouth. Novocaine mouth. Dead mouth. Squint just a little bit. Not with the lips. Dead lips. Dead lips. Eyes. Nice. Work work work work. Yes you did it. You're doing it.,INTERVIEWER, We have a Tweet question for Tyra. Do you Tweet?,INTERVIEWEE, Oh my God. I love it. I follow you.,INTERVIEWER, It's a sickness isn't it?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes. You have to like control yourself or else it will consume your life. I've done shows on Tweeting on the talk show and had people that were addicts on. But I didn't know what tweeting was yet so I was very judgmental like oh my God just put it down. I mean I don't understand. I get it now. I love it.,INTERVIEWER, It's an addiction right?,INTERVIEWEE, I love it. I love being able to connect to people. It's hard for me to walk down the street --,INTERVIEWER, There ought to be a Tweet hospital to get people off it.,INTERVIEWEE, Oh my God it should.,INTERVIEWER, Tweet for treat. Treat for treat.,INTERVIEWEE, A twospital.,INTERVIEWER, A twospital.,INTERVIEWEE, A twospital.,INTERVIEWER, All right we have a question Tweeted to us for you.,INTERVIEWEE, OK.,INTERVIEWER, "Ask Tyra what she misses most about her life as a model.",INTERVIEWEE, Oh my gosh. I miss absolutely nothing about my life as a model. Hi Tweet family. I miss absolutely nothing because I have a show that I can mentor girls and teach them every single thing that I know so I don't miss it at all. At all.,INTERVIEWER, Isn't a lot of it boring?,INTERVIEWEE, It doesn't push me creatively as much as I would like. Towards the end of my modeling career I remember some of the clients you know in between shots they would look at me and they'd go I know. Meaning I know you're done.,INTERVIEWER, It's over.,INTERVIEWEE, I know you're done. Yes I know you're ready go. But you know I like producing and creating. And I'm in the business now of creating stars. I'm more interested in that than building my own --,INTERVIEWER, You've pretty much kept the same male judges right throughout the whole "Top Model" career. How does that work? Female judges you've gone through right?,INTERVIEWEE, There are five judging spots on "America's Next Top Model." There's myself there's -- right now -- there's Miss J. and there's Nigel. But the -- was that -- no that's three. I'm sorry. There are four -- that are four permanent or semi-permanent spots. The pot of the -- the spot of the female established almost retired legendary super model is something that's my goal. So every couple of seasons we cycle that -- that position.,INTERVIEWER, How does that show --,INTERVIEWEE, We've had Twiggy --,INTERVIEWER, Why is that show so successful?,INTERVIEWEE, I think it's successful because it pulls back the curtains on a world that seems so intimidating. A world that people thought was rapid. A job that people thought took absolutely no skill. And we showed the world that it is -- it is a skill. I think it's also popular because I have made sure that I do not have just stereotypical beauty on the show. It's my passion in life. It is -- one of the reasons why I feel like I was put here is to redefine beauty to open up the doors. So I feel like I have struck gold and I have reached my goal when young girls are looking at "Top Model" and going oh if she can model -- if she can model I can model because it's saying that it is not the cookie cutter of beauty.,INTERVIEWER, Would a show on top male models work? ,INTERVIEWEE, No.,INTERVIEWER, No?,INTERVIEWEE, I don't think so because you can't name five male super models in the history of modeling. I mean you can if you're a fashion person. But if you're just you know a person that's not obsessed with the fashion industry you can't which means that the public does not really want to see that. I don't think.,INTERVIEWER, Are you big in the gay community?,INTERVIEWEE, Am I big in the gay community?,INTERVIEWER, Yes I mean you know as -- a lot of gay people follow --,INTERVIEWEE, Oh got it.,INTERVIEWER, Yes.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, Are you --,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, Are you big?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes. I thought you meant am I like -- my butt juicy and I was like what are you talking about?,INTERVIEWER, No no no.,INTERVIEWEE, I feel an affinity with the gay community. And you know why? It's because being a black woman -- a black woman I tend to connect with different areas of disenfranchised people.,INTERVIEWER, You not kidding me?,INTERVIEWEE, And I got a Glad Award for that for the representation of the gay community in "Top Model" and the talk show.,INTERVIEWER, That's -- I was proud of that. We got one too.,INTERVIEWEE, You did?,INTERVIEWER, It was very nice. Yes. Just -- there are an oppressed minority.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes I agree. And I feel like it's a minority that all other races collect together you know to pay it again.,INTERVIEWER, We're back with the one and only Tyra Banks. Back in the early days of CNN there was a feature called "Style with Elsa Klensch." In 1993 Elsa profiled Tyra. Watch.,INTERVIEWEE, Oh my God you're pulling them out. Wow.,INTERVIEWER, OK. You haven't seen that in 16 years.,INTERVIEWEE, I don't know how long that's been. I'm laughing because the things that I'm saying.,INTERVIEWER, Sixteen years.,INTERVIEWEE, I said I was going to retire from modeling when I'm like 23 24. I retired when I was like 30. So I'm laughing at that. But I still stuck by the thing of saying I'm going to leave before they kick me out. That's very important.,INTERVIEWER, Remember Elsa?,INTERVIEWEE, I loved Elsa Klensch. I learned how to walk watching her show. My mom and I used to wake up at 6:45 every morning because she would come on at 7:00. She'd come on again at 10:00. We'd watch both. This is before like VHS and stuff was really popular. And we would watch both. I'd put on my mom's heals. I would practice walking. So when I was profiled by her I was freaking out.,INTERVIEWER, Thrill of a lifetime.,INTERVIEWEE, Freaking out. She is a legend.,INTERVIEWER, Felt great watching it now didn't it?,INTERVIEWEE, That was interesting watching that. Yes it was a little -- little one.,INTERVIEWER, Now we mentioned "Gossip Girl." It's a program I'm not familiar with. What is it?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes. "Gossip Girl" is a very popular show on the CW and it takes place on the upper east side of New York City and it's based around these very wealthy super wealthy families and the teens in their lives. It's one of my favorite shows.,INTERVIEWER, And what are you going to be on it?,INTERVIEWEE, I play an actress by the name of Ursula Nyquist who's a little eccentric. She's a little roar. And Serena played by Blake Lively kind of comes to my aid and helps me out.,INTERVIEWER, Do you like acting?,INTERVIEWEE, I only like acting when I get to act crazy. I don't like -- like I have some scenes where I'm like over the top and like "Ahh!" on this "Gossip Girl" and I am much more comfortable with that than the scenes that I have with Blake Lively where I'm just like "Hey how are you doing? Yes. It's so great. So good to meet you." I'm like nervous and freaking out when I have to be normal.,INTERVIEWER, So therefore you wouldn't do a romantic comedy unless the character was nuts?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes -- unless she was out of her mind. It has to be like physical comedy. You know the kind where the girl is like crawling under the table because the boy that she loves just came in the room and she doesn't want him to know she's there. She's like "Oh my God!" Like anything physical and comedy I'm very comfortable with that. Normal girl-next-door like "Hi!" oh gosh!,INTERVIEWER, What's with the magazine?,INTERVIEWEE, My online magazine? I have been asked to do a traditional magazine for five six years all the top female publishing houses. But I felt that you know the generation that -- that I really truly connect to is really on the Internet. And I said I'm going to do an online magazine. It's at TyraBanks.com and it's all about beauty inside and out. We have fun though. It's not just like -- it's like Top Model where there definitely is medicine in there but there's so much candy going on it's just a fun experience. And every month the theme -- the theme changes. October theme is actually going to be about modeling.,INTERVIEWER, We have a Twitter question via King's Things. When is Tyra going to get married?,INTERVIEWEE, When am I going to get married? I don't know when I'm going to get married.,INTERVIEWER, Do you want to get married?,INTERVIEWEE, Marriage is not the most important thing in the world to me. I didn't grow up as a young girl saying "Oh the white horse is going to come rescue me.",INTERVIEWER, No?,INTERVIEWEE, No. Also there's so much divorce -- I want to make sure that if I get married I'm going to stay married. So that's probably why I'm not married.,INTERVIEWER, So now how do the tabloids treat you?,INTERVIEWEE, They say I'm married all the time engaged --,INTERVIEWER, They got you married to someone?,INTERVIEWEE, Oh yes. They got me engaged. They -- this is my class ring right here. They're saying this is the ring and --,INTERVIEWER, What class is that?,INTERVIEWEE, Ninety-one. High school. Immaculate Heart High School.,INTERVIEWER, Where?,INTERVIEWEE, Los Angeles California. Yes. So that's my --,INTERVIEWER, All these high school rings are alike -- black and little gold and --,INTERVIEWEE, Yes! I don't -- and I don't -- How did they think this was a -- This ring cost 200 dollars. I don't get it.,INTERVIEWER, What about that other ring? That very small ring.,INTERVIEWEE, This one cost $10. I got this at $10 -- for $10 at Nova Ice here in New York City.,INTERVIEWER, Ten dollars?,INTERVIEWEE, Ten dollars. I have them in every color. I have a whitish one. I have a brown one. I was just shopping yesterday on the street. I got a bunch of like cheap jewelry on the street.,INTERVIEWER, Well we -- we're not sure about marriage. What about kids?,INTERVIEWEE, Oh gosh! Definitely children.,INTERVIEWER, Would you adopt without being married?,INTERVIEWEE, I -- I -- I remember a quote that Angelina Jolie said and I connected to her. She said that she has an uncanny connection to children that are not necessarily from her. So I'm open to adoption I'm open to having my own children -- and I'm not against marriage I just haven't been married yet because I don't -- I don't glamorize it how a lot of young girls do. And so like someday my prince will come.,INTERVIEWER, Tyra has so many things going on. She has the challenge on her website. I'll ask her about that before she leaves us. But before she does what did you make of the whole Kanye West thing?,INTERVIEWEE, Oh -- You know I didn't actually see the VMAs because I was in a place that did not have television trying to enjoy myself and relax. But then the texting started coming. "Oh my gosh you have to see this! You have to see this!" So when I got back to New York City I went on YouTube and -- and saw it. And you know it was -- it was not the most positive situation. And later I saw Kanye on Jay Leno and I found it interesting that he was so honest and said that he has some issues and he needs to figure out something to do with what this life is all about for him. So that just let you know that there's somebody hurting and crying inside and -- and trying to figure it out by doing huge public things. I -- I was really proud of Taylor though. You know she's a baby. She's a kid you know? And she was kind of speechless for a while and then Beyonce graciously gave her that stage and she was -- I was just really proud of her because she's so young and I -- I do feel like that -- She grew up you know and became an adult in the matter -- in a matter of like an hour.,INTERVIEWER, What's the website challenge?,INTERVIEWEE, I have a challenge on TyraBanks.com. On the first week of America's Next Top Model we did a photo shoot that I've been wanting to do for a while where we took pictures of all of the models as babies and then we had them recreate that photo high fashion. And I love all young girls you know and I wanted everybody to be able to participate in this not just models. So I have a challenge on -- on TyraBanks.com where you send in a baby picture and a photo of you recreating it. I'll be interested to see you recreate some of your baby pictures. Do you have -- did you wear suspenders?,INTERVIEWER, As a baby?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes. As a kid.,INTERVIEWER, No.,INTERVIEWEE, You didn't?,INTERVIEWER, No.,INTERVIEWEE, And then I wanted to ask you something else. The suspenders -- are they for fashion or do they really hold your pants up?,INTERVIEWER, Fashion.,INTERVIEWEE, Really? So you have a belt on?,INTERVIEWER, No. I don't have a belt on.,INTERVIEWEE, Oh so you have the pants be tightened on the sides?,INTERVIEWER, No they just have buttons.,INTERVIEWEE, Oh! But they don't -- but the pants are tight enough where they don't need a belt or suspenders?,INTERVIEWER, Correct. Why don't you wear braces?,INTERVIEWEE, Oh -- should I wear?,INTERVIEWER, Yes.,INTERVIEWEE, OK. Red ones?,INTERVIEWER, Yes what the --,INTERVIEWEE, OK. I'll do a Larry King shout out. I swear I'm going to wear -- I'm going to wear suspenders or braces.,INTERVIEWER, OK. What do you think of Ellen coming on of --,INTERVIEWEE, American -- American Idol? Oh my gosh I --,INTERVIEWER, Good choice?,INTERVIEWEE, -- am going to watch her actually. I -- I cannot wait to see what she's going to say. And I -- she's like -- she's not a singer. She doesn't know about singing but she -- you know she can dance. And I think she's going to entertain the hell out of everybody. I really do. I really do.,INTERVIEWER, What haven't you done you want to do?,INTERVIEWEE, What haven't I done? I -- I want to do so much., INTERVIEWER, I know.,INTERVIEWEE, I -- Yes. I want to be able to bring the modeling experience to young girls everywhere that you don't have to look like a model to play model. And I have some great ideas for that. I -- I want to go into the publishing world. I love real estate. I don't like to spend money so I get $10 rings but I will spend it on property. And there are things that I want to do in that space to explore real estate. I want to -- so much. Do you have like another hour?,INTERVIEWER, Give me your hand. You're a doll. You are a doll.,INTERVIEWEE, Thank you.,INTERVIEWER, I'd like to know the meaning of the cover photo on your album  'Highway 61 Revisited'?,INTERVIEWEE, What would you like to know about it?,INTERVIEWER, It seems to have some philosophy in it. I'd like to know what it represents to you— you're a part of it . . .,INTERVIEWEE, I haven't really looked at it that much.,INTERVIEWER, I've thought about it a great deal.,INTERVIEWEE, It was just taken one day when I was sittin' on the steps y'know—I don't really remember too much about it.,INTERVIEWER, I thought the motorcycle was an image in your song-writing. You seem to like that.,INTERVIEWEE, Oh  we all like motorcycles to some degree.,INTERVIEWER, Do you think of yourself primarily as a singer or a poet?,INTERVIEWEE, Oh  I think of myself more as a song and dance man  y'know.,INTERVIEWER, Why?,INTERVIEWEE, Oh  I don't think we have enough time to really go into that.,INTERVIEWER, You were quoted as saying when you're really wasted you may enter into another field. How "wasted" is really wasted and do you foresee it?,INTERVIEWEE, No  I don't foresee it  but it's more or less like a ruthless type of feeling. Very ruthless and intoxicated to some degree.,INTERVIEWER, The criticism that you have received for leaving the folk field and switching to folkrock hasn't seemed to bother you a great deal. Do you think you'll stick to folk-rock or go into more writing?,INTERVIEWEE, I don't play folk-rock.,INTERVIEWER, What would you call your music?,INTERVIEWEE, I like to think of it more in terms of vision music—it's mathematical music.,INTERVIEWER, Would you say that the words are more important than the music?,INTERVIEWEE, The words are just as important as the music. There would be no music without the words.,INTERVIEWER, Which do you do first  ordinarily?,INTERVIEWEE, The words.,INTERVIEWER, Do you think there ever will be a time when you will paint or sculpt?,INTERVIEWEE, Oh  yes.,INTERVIEWER, Do you think there will ever be a time when you'll be hung as a thief?,INTERVIEWEE, You weren't supposed to say that.,INTERVIEWER, Bob you said you always do your words first and think of it as music. When you do the words can you hear it?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, The music you want when you do your words?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes  oh yes.,INTERVIEWER, Do you hear any music before you have words—do you have any songs that you don't have words to yet?,INTERVIEWEE, Ummm  sometimes  on very general instruments  not on the guitar though—maybe something like the harpsichord or the harmonica or autoharp. I might hear some kind of melody or tune which I would know the words to put to. Not with the guitar though. The guitar is too hard an instrument. I don't really hear many melodies based on the guitar.,INTERVIEWER, What poets do you dig?,INTERVIEWEE, Rimbaud  I guess; W.C. Fields; the family  you know  the trapeze family in the circus; Smokey Robinson; Allen Ginsberg; Charlie Rich— he's a good poet.,INTERVIEWER, In a lot of your songs you are hard on people—in "Like a Rolling Stone" you're hard on the girl and in "Positively 4th Street" you're hard on a friend. Do you do this because you want to change their lives  or do you want to point out to them the error of their ways?,INTERVIEWEE, I want to needle them.,INTERVIEWER, Do you still sing your older songs?,INTERVIEWEE, No. No. I just saw a songbook last night  I don't really see too many of those things  but there's a lotta songs in those books I haven't even recorded  y'know. I've just written down  and y'know and put little tunes to and they published them. I haven't sung them  though. A lotta the songs I just don't even know anymore  even the ones I did sing. There doesn't seem to be enough time  y'know.,INTERVIEWER, Did you change your program when you went to England?,INTERVIEWEE, No  no  I finished it there. That was the end of my older program. I didn't change it  it was developed and by the time we got there it was all  it was more or less  I knew what was going to happen all the time  y'know. I knew how many encores there was  y'know  which songs they were going to clap loudest and all this kind of things.,INTERVIEWER, In a concert tour like this do you do the same program night after night?,INTERVIEWEE, Oh  sometimes it's different. I think we'll do the same one here in this area  though.,INTERVIEWER, In a recent 'Broadside' interview  Phil Ochs said you should do films. Do you have any plans to do this?,INTERVIEWEE, I do have plans to make a film but not because anybody said I should do it.,INTERVIEWER, How soon will this be?,INTERVIEWEE, Next year probably.,INTERVIEWER, Can you tell us what it will be about?,INTERVIEWEE, It'll be just another song.,INTERVIEWER, Who are the people making films that you dig  particularly?,INTERVIEWEE, Truffaut. I really can't think of any more people. Italian movie directors  y'know  but not too many people in England and the United States which I really think that I would dig.,INTERVIEWER, You did a Chaplin bit as an exit in a concert once.,INTERVIEWEE, I did! That musta been an accident. Have to stay away from that kind of thing.,INTERVIEWER, What do you think of people who analyze your songs?,INTERVIEWEE, I welcome them—with open arms.,INTERVIEWER, The University of California mimeographed all the lyrics from the last album and had a symposium discussing them. Do you welcome that?,INTERVIEWEE, Oh  sure. I'm just kinda sad I'm not around to be a part of it.,INTERVIEWER, Josh Dunson in his new book implies that you have sold out to commercial interests and the topical song movement. Do you have any comment  sir?,INTERVIEWEE, Well  no comments  no arguments. No  I sincerely don't feel guilty.,INTERVIEWER, Of all the people who record your compositions  who do you feel does the most justice to what you're trying to say?,INTERVIEWEE, I think Manfred Mann. They've done the songs—they've done about three or four. Each one of them has been right in context with what the song was all about.,INTERVIEWER, What's your new album about?,INTERVIEWEE, Oh  it's about  uh—just about all kinds of different things—rats  balloons. They're about the only thing that comes to my mind right now.,INTERVIEWER, Mr. Dylan  how would you define folk music?,INTERVIEWEE, As a constitutional re-play of mass production.,INTERVIEWER, Would you call your songs "folk songs"?,INTERVIEWEE, No.,INTERVIEWER, Are protest songs "folk songs"?,INTERVIEWEE, I guess  if they're a constitutional re-play of mass production.,INTERVIEWER, Do you prefer songs with a subtle or obvious message?,INTERVIEWEE, With a what???,INTERVIEWER, A subtle or obvious message?,INTERVIEWEE, Uh—I don't really prefer those kinds of songs at all—"message" you mean like—,INTERVIEWER, what songs with a message?,INTERVIEWEE, Well  like "Eve of Destruction" and things like that.,INTERVIEWER, Do I prefer that to what?,INTERVIEWEE, I don't know  but your songs are supposed to have a subtle message. Subtle message???,INTERVIEWER, Well  they're supposed to.,INTERVIEWEE, Where'd you hear that?,INTERVIEWER, In a movie magazine?,INTERVIEWEE, Oh—Oh God! Well  we won't—we don't discuss those things here.,INTERVIEWER, Are your songs ever about real people?,INTERVIEWEE, Sure they are  they're all about real people.,INTERVIEWER, Particular ones?,INTERVIEWEE, Particular people? Sure  I'm sure you've seen all the people in my songs—at one time or another.,INTERVIEWER, Who is Mr. Jones?,INTERVIEWEE, Mr. Jones  I'm not going to tell you his first name. I'd get sued.,INTERVIEWER, What does he do for a living?,INTERVIEWEE, He's a pinboy. He also wears suspenders.,INTERVIEWER, How do you explain your attraction?,INTERVIEWEE, Attraction to what?,INTERVIEWER, Your attraction—your popularity—your mass popularity.,INTERVIEWEE, No  no. I really have no idea. That's the truth. I always tell the truth. That is the truth.,INTERVIEWER, What are your own personal hopes for the future and what do you hope to change in the world?,INTERVIEWEE, Oh  my hopes for the future: to be honest  you know  I don't have any hopes for the future and I just hope to have enough boots to be able to change them. That's all really  it doesn't boil down to anything more than that. If it did  I would certainly tell you.,INTERVIEWER, What do you think of a question and answer session of this type (with you as the principal subject)?,INTERVIEWEE, Well  I think we all have different—uh—(I may have dropped an ash on myself somewhere—you'll see in a minute here)—I'm not going to say anything about it though—uh—what was the question?,INTERVIEWER, What are you thinking about right now?,INTERVIEWEE, I'm thinking about this ash.,INTERVIEWER, Right before that.,INTERVIEWEE, Uh—the ash is creeping up on me somewhere—I've lost—lost touch with myself so I can't tell where exactly it is.,INTERVIEWER, Was that an inadvertent evading of the question?,INTERVIEWEE, No  no—,INTERVIEWER, What do you feel about the meaning of this kind of question and answer session?,INTERVIEWEE, I just know in my own mind that we all have a different idea of all the words we're using—uh—y'know so I don't really have too much—I really can't take it too seriously because everything—like if I say the word "house"—like we're both going to see a different house. If I just say the word—right? So we're using all these other words like "mass production" and "movie magazine" and we all have a different idea of these words too  so I don't even know what we're saying.,INTERVIEWER, Is it pointless?,INTERVIEWEE, No  it's not pointless. It's—it's—you know  if you want to do it  you're there—then that's not pointless. You know  it doesn't hurt me any.,INTERVIEWER, Is there anything in addition to your songs that you want to say to people?,INTERVIEWEE, Good luck.,INTERVIEWER, You don't say that in your songs.,INTERVIEWEE, Oh  yes I do  every song tails off with "Good luck—I hope you make it.",INTERVIEWER, Why couldn't you— uh-,INTERVIEWEE, Who are you? Get the camera on this person here.,INTERVIEWER, What do you bother to write the poetry for if we all get different images? If we don't know what you're talking about.,INTERVIEWEE, Because I got nothing else to do  man.,INTERVIEWER, Do you have a rhyme for "orange"?,INTERVIEWEE, What  I didn't hear that.,INTERVIEWER, A rhyme for "orange.",INTERVIEWEE, A-ha . . . just a rhyme for "orange"?,INTERVIEWER, Is it true that you were censored for singing on the Ed Sullivan show  etc.   etc.,INTERVIEWEE, I'll tell you the rhyme in a minute.,INTERVIEWER, Did they censor you from singing what you wanted on the Ed Sullivan show?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes. It was a long time ago.,INTERVIEWER, What did you want to sing?,INTERVIEWEE, I don't know. It was some song which I wanted to sing and they said I could sing. There's more to it than just censorship there. They actually said I could sing the song  but when we went through the rehearsal of it  the guy came back afterwards and said that I'd have to change it and he said  "Can't you sing some folk song like the Clancy Brothers do?" And I didn't know any of their songs and so I couldn't get on the program. That's the way it came down.,INTERVIEWER, Have you found that the text of the interviews with you are accurate to the original conversations?,INTERVIEWEE, No. That's another reason I don't really give press interviews or anything  because you know  I mean  even if you do something—there are a lot of people here  so they know what's going on—but like if you just do it with one guy or two guys  they just take it all out of context  you know  they just take it  split it up in the middle or just take what they want to use and they even ask you a question and you answer it and then it comes out in print that they just substitute another question for your answer. It's not really truthful  you know  to do that kind of thing  so I just don't do it. That's just a press problem there.,INTERVIEWER, Do you think the entire text of your news conference today should be printed in the newspaper?,INTERVIEWEE, Oh no  nothing like that  nothing like that. But this is just for the interview  you know  when they want to do interviews in places like Omaha  or in Cincinnati  man  you know. I don't do it and then they write bad things.,INTERVIEWER, Well  isn't this partly because you are often inaudible? Like  for most of this dialogue you have been inaudible  and now when you are touched personally by the misquotation  your voice rises and we can hear you.,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah  well  I just realized that maybe the people in the back there can't hear me  that's all.,INTERVIEWER, I was just going to ask you—in your songs you sing out—,INTERVIEWEE, Yes I do.,INTERVIEWER, And whether .. .,INTERVIEWEE, You see the songs are what I do—write the songs and sing them and perform them. That's what I do. The performing part of it could end  but like I'm going to be writing these songs and singing them and recording them and I see no end  right now. That's what I do—uh—anything else interferes with it. I mean anything else trying to get on top of it making something out of it which it isn't  it just brings me down  and it's not  uh—it just makes it seem all very cheap.,INTERVIEWER, Well  it made me feel like you were almost kind of doing a penance of silence here .. .,INTERVIEWEE, No  no.,INTERVIEWER, The first half.,INTERVIEWEE, I'm not one of those kind of people at all. ,INTERVIEWER, You don't need silence?,INTERVIEWEE, No  no silence. It's always silent where I am.,INTERVIEWER, Mr. Dylan  when you're on a concert tour how many people travel in your party?,INTERVIEWEE, We travel with about 12 people now.,INTERVIEWER, Do the number of people seem to go with the amount of money you're making?,INTERVIEWEE, Oh  yes  of course.,INTERVIEWER, Is that known as Dylan's law?,INTERVIEWEE, We have the band  we have five in the group. And we need other things; we have to—it's a lot of electronic equipment now  a lot of different things which have to be taken care of so we need a lot of people. We have three Road Managers and things like that. We don't make any big public presentations though  like we never come into town in limousines or anything like that. We just—uh—go from place to place  you know  and do the shows. That's all.,INTERVIEWER, You fly in your own plane?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes  yes.,INTERVIEWER, Do you have to get in a certain type of mood to write your music?,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah  I guess so. A certain type of mood  if you want to call it that.,INTERVIEWER, Do you find that you are more creative at a certain time of the day?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes  yes  I feel that way.,INTERVIEWER, Like a night writer?,INTERVIEWEE, I would say night has nothing to do with it.,INTERVIEWER, Have you ever sung with the Beatles?,INTERVIEWEE, No. Well  I think we have messed around in London  but  no I don't think anything serious.,INTERVIEWER, Have you ever played a dance?,INTERVIEWEE, No. It's not that kind of music., INTERVIEWER, It. is,INTERVIEWEE, Well  what can I say. You must know more about the music than I do. How long have you been playing it?,INTERVIEWER, Do you find that when you're writing you free-associate often?,INTERVIEWEE, No  it's all very clear and simple to me. These songs aren't complicated to me at all. I know what they are all about! There's nothing hard to figure out for me. I wouldn't write anything I can't really see.,INTERVIEWER, I don't mean it that way. I meant when you're creating a song are you doing it on a subliminal level?,INTERVIEWEE, No. That's the difference in the songs I write now. In the past year or so—in the last year and a half  maybe two  I don't know—the songs before  up till one of these records  I wrote the fourth record in Greece—there was a change there  but the records before that  I used to know what I wanted to say  before I used to write the song. All the stuff which I had written before which wasn't song  was just on a piece of toilet paper. When it comes out like that it's the kind of stuff I never would sing because people would just not be ready for it. But I just went through that other thing of writing songs and I couldn't write like it anymore. It was just too easy and it wasn't really "right." I would start out  I would know what I wanted to say before I wrote the song and I would say it  you know  and it would never come out exactly the way I thought it would  but it came out  you know  it touched it  but now  I just write a song  like I know that it's just going to be all right and I don't really know exactly what it's all about  but I do know the minutes and the layers of what it's all about.,INTERVIEWER, What did you think about your song "It's Alright  Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)"? It happens to be my favorite one.,INTERVIEWEE, God bless you  son. I haven't heard it for a long time. I couldn't even sing it for you probably.,INTERVIEWER, How long does it take you to write a .. .,INTERVIEWEE, Usually not too long a time  really. I might write all night and get one song out of a lot of different things I write.,INTERVIEWER, How many have you written?,INTERVIEWEE, Uh—I guess  well  there's one publisher that's got about a hundred. I've written about fifty others I guess. I got about 150 songs I've written.,INTERVIEWER, Have they all been published?,INTERVIEWEE, No  some of the scraps haven't been published. But I find I can't really sing that anyway  because I forget it  so the songs I don't publish  I usually do forget.,INTERVIEWER, Have you ever taken these scraps and made them into a song?,INTERVIEWEE, No  I've forgotten the scraps. I have to start over all the time. I can't really keep notes or anything like that.,INTERVIEWER, You can't go back to one of your earlier things and use them in your . . .,INTERVIEWEE, No  no. That wouldn't be right either.,INTERVIEWER, On your songs do you get any help from the rest of your entourage?,INTERVIEWEE, Robbie  the lead guitar player  sometimes we play the guitars together— something might come up—but I know it's going to be right. I'll be just sitting around playing so I can write up some words. I don't get any ideas though of what I want to or what's really going to happen here.,INTERVIEWER, Why do you think you're so popular?,INTERVIEWEE, I don't know. I'm not a reporter  I'm not a newsman or anything. I'm not even a philosopher  so I have no idea I would think other people would know  but I don't think I know. You know  when you get too many people talking about the same thing it tends to clutter up things. Everybody asks me that so I realize they must be talking about it  so I'd rather stay out of it and make it easier for them. Then  when they get the answer  I hope they tell me.,INTERVIEWER, Has there been any more booing?,INTERVIEWEE, Oh  there's booing—you can't tell where the booing is going to come up. Can't tell at all. It comes up in the weirdest  strangest places and when it comes it's quite a thing in itself. I figure there's a little "boo" in all of us.,INTERVIEWER, Bob  where is Desolation Row?,INTERVIEWEE, Where? Oh  that's someplace in Mexico. It's across the border. It's noted for its Coke factory. Coca-Cola machines are—sells—sell a lotta Coca-Cola down there.,INTERVIEWER, Where is Highway 61 ?,INTERVIEWEE, Highway 61 exists—that's out in the middle of the country. It runs down to the south  goes up north.,INTERVIEWER, Mr. Dylan  you seem very reluctant to talk about the fact that you're a popular entertainer—a most popular entertainer.,INTERVIEWEE, Well  what do you want me to say?,INTERVIEWER, Well  I don't understand why you . .,INTERVIEWEE, Well  what do you want me to say? What do you want me to say  d'you want me to say—who—who—What do you want me to say about it?,INTERVIEWER, You seem almost embarrassed to admit that you're popular.,INTERVIEWEE, Well  I'm not embarrassed  I mean  you know—Well  what do you want  exactly— for me to say. You want me to jump up and say "Hallelujah!"—and crash the cameras or do something weird? Tell me  tell me. I'll go along with you  if I can't go along with you  I'll find somebody to go along with you.,INTERVIEWER, I find that you really have no idea as to why you are popular  no thoughts on why you are popular.,INTERVIEWEE, I just haven't really struggled for that. It happened  you know? It happened like anything else happens. Just a happening. You don't try to figure out happenings. You dig happenings. So I'm not going to even talk about it.,INTERVIEWER, Do you feel that part of the popularity is because of a kind of identification?,INTERVIEWEE, I have no idea. I don't really come too much in contact.,INTERVIEWER, Does it make life more difficult?,INTERVIEWEE, No  it certainly doesn't.,INTERVIEWER, Were you surprised the first time the boos came?,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah  that was at Newport. Well  I did this very crazy thing. I didn't know what was going to happen  but they certainly booed  I'll tell you that. You could hear it all over the place. I don't know who they were though  and I'm certain whoever it was did it twice as loud as they normally would. They kind of quieted down some at Forest Hills although they did it there  too. They've done it just about all over except in Texas—they didn't boo us in Texas or in Atlanta or in Boston  or in Ohio. They've done it in just about—or in Minneapolis  they didn't do it there. They've done it a lot of other places. I mean  they must be pretty rich  to be able to go someplace and boo. I couldn't afford it if I was in their shoes.,INTERVIEWER, Other than booing  have the audiences changed much? Do they scream and get hysterical and rush on stage?,INTERVIEWEE, Oh  sometimes you get people rushing the stage  but you just  y'know—turn 'em off very fast. Kick 'em in the head or something like that. They get the picture.,INTERVIEWER, You said that you don't know why you are so popular. That is in direct opposition to what most people who reach this level of popularity say.,INTERVIEWEE, Well  you see  a lot of people start out and they plan to try to be stars  I would imagine  like  however  they have to be stars. I mean I know a lot of those people  you know? And they start out and they go into show business for many  many reasons  to be seen  you know. I started out  you know  like this had nothing to do with it when I started. I started from New York City  you know  and there just wasn't any of that around. It just happened.,INTERVIEWER, Don't misunderstand me  I agree with your right not to have to care  my point is that it would be somewhat disappointing for the people who think that you feel towards them  the way that they feel towards you.,INTERVIEWEE, Oh—well  I don't want to disappoint anybody. I mean  tell me what I should say— you know  I'll certainly go along with anything  but I really don't have much of an idea.,INTERVIEWER, You have a poster there.,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah  it's a poster somebody gave me. It looks pretty good. The Jefferson Airplane  John Handy  and Sam Thomas and the Mystery Trend and the Great Society and all playing at the Fillmore Auditorium this Friday  December 10th  and I would like to go if I could  but unfortunately  I won't be here  I don't think  but if I was here  I certainly would be there.,INTERVIEWER, What's more important to you: The way that your music and words sound  or the content  the message?,INTERVIEWEE, The whole thing while it's happening. The whole total sound of the words  what's really going down is—it either happens or it doesn't happen  you know. That's what I feel is—just the thing  which is happening there at that time. That's what we do  you know? That is the most important thing  there really isn't anything else. I don't know if I answered your question.,INTERVIEWER, You mean it might happen one time  and it might not happen the next?,INTERVIEWEE, We've had some bad nights  but we always take good cuts for the records. The records are always made out of good cuts and in person most of the time it does come across. Most of the time we do feel like playing. That's important  to me; the aftermath  and whatever happens before  is not really important to me; just the time on the stage and the time that we're singing the songs and performing them. Or not really performing them even  just letting them be there.,INTERVIEWER, If you were going to sell out to a commercial interest  which one would you choose?,INTERVIEWEE, Ladies garments.,INTERVIEWER, Bob  have you worked with any rock & roll groups?,INTERVIEWEE, Uh  professionally?,INTERVIEWER, Or just sitting in or on concert tours with them. ,INTERVIEWEE, No  no  I don't usually play too much.,INTERVIEWER, Do you listen to other people's recordings of your songs?,INTERVIEWEE, Sometimes. A few of them I've heard. I don't really come across it that much though.,INTERVIEWER, Is it a strange experience?,INTERVIEWEE, No  it's like a  more or less like a  heavenly kind of thing.,INTERVIEWER, What do you think of Joan Baez's interpretations of your earlier songs?,INTERVIEWEE, I haven't heard her latest album  or her one before that. I heard one. She does 'em all right  I think.,INTERVIEWER, What about Donovan's "Colors" and his things? Do you think he's a good poet?,INTERVIEWEE, Ehh. He's a nice guy  though.,INTERVIEWER, I'm shattered.,INTERVIEWEE, Well  you needn't be.,INTERVIEWER, Are there any young folksingers you would recommend that we hear?,INTERVIEWEE, I'm glad you asked that. Oh  yeah  there's the Sir Douglas Quintet  I think are probably the best that are going to have a chance of reaching the commercial airways. They already have with a couple of songs.,INTERVIEWER, What about Paul Butterfield?,INTERVIEWEE, They're good.,INTERVIEWER, Mr. Dylan  you call yourself a completely disconnected person.,INTERVIEWEE, No  I didn't call myself that. They sort of drove those words in my mouth. I saw that paper.,INTERVIEWER, How would you describe yourself . Have you analyzed .. .,INTERVIEWEE, I certainly haven't. No.,INTERVIEWER, Mr. Dylan  I know you dislike labels and probably rightfully so  but for those of us well over thirty  could you label yourself and perhaps tell us what your role is?,INTERVIEWEE, Well  I'd sort of label myself as "well under thirty." And my role is to just  y'know  to just stay here as long as I can.,INTERVIEWER, Phil Ochs wrote in `Broadside' that you have twisted so many people's wigs that he feels it becomes increasingly dangerous for you to perform in Public.,INTERVIEWEE, Well  that's the way it goes  you know. I don't  I can't apologize certainly.,INTERVIEWER, Did you envision the time when you would give five concerts in one area like this within ten days?,INTERVIEWEE, No. This is all very new to me.,INTERVIEWER, If you were draftable at present  do you know what your feelings might be?,INTERVIEWEE, No. I'd probably just do what had to be done.,INTERVIEWER, What would that be?,INTERVIEWEE, Well  I don't know  I never really speak in terms of "what if”' y'know  so I don't really know.,INTERVIEWER, Are you going to participate in the Vietnam Day Committee demonstration in front of the Fairmont Hotel tonight.,INTERVIEWEE, No  I'll be busy tonight.,INTERVIEWER, You planning any demonstrations?,INTERVIEWEE, Well  we thought—one. I don't know if it could be organized in time.,INTERVIEWER, Would you describe it?,INTERVIEWEE, Uh—well it was a demonstration where I make up the cards you know  they have— uh—they have a group of protesters here—uh perhaps carrying cards with pictures of the Jack of Diamonds on them and the Ace of Spades on them. Pictures of mules  maybe words and— oh maybe about 25-30 000 of these things printed up and just picket  carry signs and picket in front of the post office.,INTERVIEWER, What words?,INTERVIEWEE, Oh  words: "camera " "microphone"—"loose"--just words—names of some famous people.,INTERVIEWER, Do you consider yourself a politician?,INTERVIEWEE, Do I consider myself a politician? Oh  I guess so. I have my own party though.,INTERVIEWER, Does it have a name?,INTERVIEWEE, No. There's no presidents in the party—there's no presidents  or vice presidents  or secretaries or anything like that  so it makes it kinda hard to get in.,INTERVIEWER, Is there any right wing or left wing in that party?,INTERVIEWEE, No. It's more or less in the center—kind of on the Uppity scale.,INTERVIEWER, Do you think your party could end the war with China?,INTERVIEWEE, Uh—I don't know. I don't know if they would have any people over there that would be in the same kind of party. Y'know? It might be kind of hard to infiltrate. I don't think my party would ever be approved by the White House or anything like that.,INTERVIEWER, Is there anyone else in your party?,INTERVIEWEE, No. Most of us don't even know each other  y'know. It's hard to tell who's in it and who's not in it.,INTERVIEWER, Would you recognize them if you see them?,INTERVIEWEE, Oh  you can recognize the people when you see them.,INTERVIEWER, How long do you think it will be before you will finally quit?,INTERVIEWEE, Gee  I don't know. I could answer that you know  but it would mean something different probably for everybody  so we want to keep away from those kind of sayings.,INTERVIEWER, What did you mean when you said .. .,INTERVIEWEE, I don't know  what things were we talking about?,INTERVIEWER, You said I don't think things can turn out on a .. .,INTERVIEWEE, No  no  no—it's not that I don't think things can turn out  I don't think anything you plan ever turns out the way you plan.,INTERVIEWER, Is that your philosophy?,INTERVIEWEE, No  no. Doesn't mean anything.,INTERVIEWER, Do you think that it's fun to put on an audience.,INTERVIEWEE, I don't know  I've never done it.,INTERVIEWER, You wrote a song called "Mama  You Been On My Mind." Do you sing it in concerts?,INTERVIEWEE, No I haven't. No I haven't.,INTERVIEWER, Are the concerts fun still?,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah. Concerts are much more fun than they used to be.,INTERVIEWER, Do you consider them more important than your albums  for instance?,INTERVIEWEE, No. It's just a kick to do it now. The albums are the most important.,INTERVIEWER, Because they reach more people?,INTERVIEWEE, No  because it's all concise  it's very concise  and it's easy to hear the words and everything. There's no chance of the sound interfering  whereas in a concert  we've played some concerts where sometimes they have those very bad halls. You know  microphone systems. So it's not that easy for somebody to just come and listen to a band as if they were listening to one person  you know.,INTERVIEWER, Do you consider your old songs less valid than the ones you are putting out now?,INTERVIEWEE, No  I just consider them something else to themselves  you know for another time  another dimension. It would be kind of dishonest for me to sing them now  because I wouldn't really feel like singing them.,INTERVIEWER, What is the strangest thing that ever happened to you?,INTERVIEWEE, You're gonna get it  man.,INTERVIEWER, What is the weirdest thing that ever happened to you?,INTERVIEWEE, I'll talk to you about it  later. I wouldn't do that to you.,INTERVIEWER, What areas in music that you haven't gotten into do you hope to get into?,INTERVIEWEE, Writing a symphony—with different melodies and different words  different ideas— all being the same which just roll on top of each other and underneath each other.,INTERVIEWER, Mr. Dylan  when would you know that it was time to get out of the music field into another field?,INTERVIEWEE, When I get very dragged.,INTERVIEWER, When you stop making money?,INTERVIEWEE, No  when my teeth get better—or God  when something makes a drastic—uh—when I start to itch  y'know? When something just goes to a terrifying turn and I know it's got nothing to do with anything and I know it's time to leave.,INTERVIEWER, You say you would like to write symphonies. Is this in the terms that we think of symphonies?,INTERVIEWEE, I'm not sure. Songs are all written as part of a symphony—different melodies  different changes—with words or without them  you know  but the end result being a total . . . I mean they say that my songs are long now  y'know  well sometime it's just gonna come up with the one that's going to be one whole album  consisting of one song. I don't know who's going to buy it. That might be the time to leave.,INTERVIEWER, What's the longest song you've recorded?,INTERVIEWEE, I don't know. I don't really check those things  they just turn out long. I guess I've recorded one about 11 or 12 minutes long. "Ballad of Hollis Brown" was pretty long on the second record and "With God on Our Side" was kind of long. But none of them  I don't think  are as much into anything as "Desolation Row" was  and that was long  too. Songs shouldn't seem long  y'know  it just so happens that it looks that way on paper  y'know. The length of it doesn't have anything to do with it.,INTERVIEWER, Doesn't this give you a problem in issuing records?,INTERVIEWEE, No  they are just ready to do anything that I put down now  so they don't really care.,INTERVIEWER, What happens if they have to cut a song in half like "Subterranean Homesick Blues"?,INTERVIEWEE, They didn't have to cut that in half.,INTERVIEWER, They didn't have to but they did.,INTERVIEWEE, No they didn't.,INTERVIEWER, Yeah?,INTERVIEWEE, No. You're talking about "Like a Rolling Stone.",INTERVIEWER, Oh  yeah.,INTERVIEWEE, They cut it in half for the disc jockeys. Well  you see  it didn't matter for the disc jockeys if they had it cut in half because the other side was just a continuation on the other side and if anybody was interested they could just turn it over and listen to what really happens  you know. We just made a song the other day which came out ten minutes long  and I thought of releasing it as a single but they would have easily released it and just cut it up but it wouldn't have worked that way so we're not going to turn it out as a single. It's called "Freeze Out" you'll hear it on the next album.,INTERVIEWER, If this whole thing could go back to the whole thing? Would you just have not have sold the stock what?,INTERVIEWEE, Well that's a hard question because I sold it for a specific reason it was going down. And I can't imagine I mean it's just such a conundrum to decide what I could have done what I should have done what I should have done afterward. There's so many variables Larry in a thing like this.,INTERVIEWER, It boggles the mind though doesn't it your own case to think that would've should've could've?,INTERVIEWEE, You wake up pretty much every night about 2:00 a.m. Saying oh my gosh what if I had. What if what if what if. And that's pretty terrible for a 2 and half year process like this.,INTERVIEWER, Some of the things that have developed recently with some fair questions. Why not serve it you'd only serve about four months I think on mandatory do 80 percent. You serve four months the stock...,INTERVIEWEE, Are you an expert?,INTERVIEWER, I think it is four months. I think it's 80 percent.,INTERVIEWEE, Do you think or do you know?,INTERVIEWER, I'm pretty sure. Anyway but I know you don't...,INTERVIEWEE, I haven't done my research totally yet on any of this. And we have a good appeal. We have -- I have not made up my mind one way or the other.,INTERVIEWER, You mean you might serve?,INTERVIEWEE, Well again there's a conundrum. My company needs me. I would like to get back to work. I would like this to be over. This has been a long drawn-out process. And I would like very much to go back to work. On the one hand business Wall Street advertising they would like to see finality. They would like to see an end to all of this.,INTERVIEWER, Obviously.,INTERVIEWEE, I as a person with rights with a belief in the judicial system and fairness think that an appeal is the way to go. So what do I do OK. If it weren't wrapped up with my company and it shouldn't be but it is inextricably. What do you do? What would you do Larry?,INTERVIEWER, That's a fair question.,INTERVIEWEE, This is a hard thing. And people say -- and pundits are out there saying oh she should go in. Do they know what it's like to go to jail? I don't think they know.,INTERVIEWER, Everybody seems to always...,INTERVIEWEE, I don't know what it's like to go to jail.,INTERVIEWER, There are a lot of people saying I'd go do it. I'd get it over with.,INTERVIEWEE, I know why? Why do they say that? Would they do it themselves?,INTERVIEWER, No they say it for you.,INTERVIEWEE, Of course. Of course. It's easy to say what somebody else should do. But what to do is the problem here.,INTERVIEWER, Since you are so involved in business and so caring about your business are you leaning toward possibly doing it since that would stabilize the market?,INTERVIEWEE, I have two options either to go or not to go. But no actually I have three options.,INTERVIEWER, What's the third?,INTERVIEWEE, Well to go and appeal. So you can go in and not appeal. You can go in and -- we've left out it's very open. Because we are out on bail pending appeal. Luckily we...,INTERVIEWER, What if you go serve and you win your appeal? Then what do you get?,INTERVIEWEE, Well...,INTERVIEWER, Just a clearinghouse right?,INTERVIEWEE, Right. But then I mean that's another question. What do I get? I'd have peace of mind. I'm finished. I don't have to go back to another trial maybe. I don't know if you have to go back to another trial after that or not. No one...,INTERVIEWER, You don't want that do you?,INTERVIEWEE, No I do not. It's very very difficult to go through a trial like this.,INTERVIEWER, That's would have come down on the side of serving forgetting dropping the appeal. Serving getting over with because you could win the appeal and they order a new trial.,INTERVIEWEE, Well they could but maybe not. Maybe the appeal -- again I'm not an expert. I have wonderful appeals attorneys working on this. Walter Dellinger and his full team. And I -- I'm going to you know take their advice but I have to make up my mind.,INTERVIEWER, Alan Dershowitz the famous appeals lawyer said the other day you have a great appeal.,INTERVIEWEE, Well everybody has an idea whether it's Alan Dershowitz or Bob Morvillo or Walter Dellinger everybody has something to say. And I appreciate all their opinions. And I have to weigh it myself. No one can make up my mind.,INTERVIEWER, There were some criticizing for a remark you made I think with Barbara Walters about comparing to Nelson Mandela. You want to straighten us out on that?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes I would like to straighten you out on that. Not you but the press. What I said Barbara asked me something about you know how are you going to do this? And what I said and I am so in awe and so -- I love Nelson Mandela so much. I said Nelson Mandela was able to survive 27 years in prison I could survive five years. I wasn't comparing myself to Nelson Mandela. I am not a Nobel Prize winner. I am -- my -- our situations are -- well it shouldn't have and it didn't. If you watch the tape. I watched it. I mean I didn't seem like I was comparing myself to Nelson Mandela in any way. And I really don't want anybody to be confused about that.,INTERVIEWER, When you walked out of the courtroom and made that statement which had to be a very pressure situation for you you also asked people to have faith in your business. Did you think a lot about that since it looked like you were also pitching.,INTERVIEWEE, Well again...,INTERVIEWER, Of course that's what you've done all your life so.,INTERVIEWEE, Well I am -- you know I have a company called Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia. Our company makes wonderful products. Our company continues to make wonderful trusted terrific products best quality. And it is my job -- one of my jobs is to tell people to buy our products encourage people to buy our products hope that people buy our products because they're good. You know that. I've been on your program for years.,INTERVIEWER, You have.,INTERVIEWEE, I'm bringing beautiful things to your viewing public. I've done that on our television program for years and years and years. So I'm not -- I'm not going to stop and say you know what don't buy our products. I mean this is part of what I do. And one way that all our supporters and we have so many terrific supporters Larry and that's what I found during this entire process. That there are many many many millions of people out there that care that kind of question the whole process that has -- that I've gone through and will support us.,INTERVIEWER, You made the strong statement that you have faith in the legal system. Do you like this judge? Was she fair in your opinion? And what do you think of mandatory sentencing?,INTERVIEWEE, OK well that's a lot of questions in one question. Judge Cedarbaum is an elegant lady. She happened to go to the same college I went to do you know that?,INTERVIEWER, No.,INTERVIEWEE, Oh yes she went to Barnard College where I went my daughter went several people in our family went. And I think she is an intelligent judge. I think she took this entirely seriously. She had great faith in her jurors. She had great faith again in the legal system as I went into this process having. And that said I think that -- what was the second part of your question?,INTERVIEWER, Mandatory sentencing. She gave you the minimum.,INTERVIEWEE, She did and I am grateful for that. I think that the sentencing guidelines are under a siege right now. Many judges in America are questioning the validity of the sentencing guidelines. I'm not an expert in that but when I see and hear what I've been hearing about them the question of the validity of them is going to the Supreme Court.,INTERVIEWER, Emotionally this roller coaster ride how are you doing?,INTERVIEWEE, Well you know as a child I loved the roller coaster. I hate this process. I hate it. It has been really devastating. And very very difficult.,INTERVIEWER, We're back with Martha Stewart. By the way there is -- I know a lot of people are writing President Bush about pardoning. He could pardon you tomorrow and it's over.,INTERVIEWEE, Wouldn't that be nice.,INTERVIEWER, Would you ask for that?,INTERVIEWEE, Would I accept a pardon?,INTERVIEWER, Yes yes.,INTERVIEWEE, Of course.,INTERVIEWER, Some people decline because a pardon doesn't mean you didn't do it. It just means you're pardoned.,INTERVIEWEE, Well I would like to be out of this mess.,INTERVIEWER, You'd accept a pardon?,INTERVIEWEE, I would.,INTERVIEWER, In your letter to the judge you offered an explanation for the sale. You said it was not because I was secretly tipped but because I set a price made a profit when it was sold. Which has happened every day in America right? so the question is obvious why you?,INTERVIEWEE, Well we don't know.,INTERVIEWER, Why do you think you?,INTERVIEWEE, Many people have said that it is because I am a woman. Many people have said it is because I am a business person a successful business person. But maybe so. I don't know for sure.,INTERVIEWER, What do you think?,INTERVIEWEE, I don't know. I think it was a combination and a coincidence. And I think that even though the government says there's no such thing as coincidence I think there is coincidence in this world.,INTERVIEWER, So it just -- the breaks (ph) didn't fall?,INTERVIEWEE, Well they fell in the wrong place didn't they?,INTERVIEWER, From your standpoint?,INTERVIEWEE, Oh yes indeed.,INTERVIEWER, All right. We didn't get a chance to talk on the air. We did talk off the air after the verdict. What was that day like?,INTERVIEWEE, Friday?,INTERVIEWER, No not the sentence the verdict.,INTERVIEWEE, Oh excuse me.,INTERVIEWER, You didn't do any interviews since the verdict.,INTERVIEWEE, No I haven't. Well we were very disappointed obviously.,INTERVIEWER, Surprised?,INTERVIEWEE, I think we were all very surprised. We had sat in the courtroom all of us the whole legal team my daughter I my family my friends and all of us thought that there would be exoneration. We were so wrong obviously. And we were very sad. And it's been again a long wait to last Friday.,INTERVIEWER, Were you surprised at the sentence?,INTERVIEWEE, You're always surprised at something like that I would think. And you can't say that you're happy. You can't say I mean I'm happy that it's five months in and five months house arrest. Rather than 16 months in prison. Which -- that was the sentencing guidelines. And the judge stayed within the minimum. I'm grateful for that.,INTERVIEWER, But not surprised? I mean you expect to get no time? ,INTERVIEWEE, You learn a lot when you go through a process like this Larry. And there are things called pre-sentencing memos from the probation officer.,INTERVIEWER, Who interviews you right?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes yes and then he makes suggestions to the judge. The judge looks through the entire case again and again and again I'm sure. Reads all the wonderful letters of support that came on my behalf. She then has to work with the sentencing guidelines and the probation officers and their superiors. So it's a big process. And they come to a conclusion. And the conclusion was what I was sentenced to.,INTERVIEWER, Your daughter who appeared with us after the verdict took it very badly.,INTERVIEWEE, Oh yes. When the verdict came...,INTERVIEWER, Worse than you.,INTERVIEWEE, Well when the verdict was passed she actually fainted and I heard sort of the thump and I thought well maybe that's just a bang on the bench but she had actually fainted. And that's horrible. But she did come. I didn't -- for the sentencing I really didn't want anybody to come. And yet the night before...,INTERVIEWER, No?,INTERVIEWEE, Oh no I didn't. I really felt horrible about going down there again and hearing a fate. And she insisted on coming. Other people insisted on coming and came even though I didn't invite them. And my mom I asked my mom not to come. She's just -- she's taken this really hard. And I asked her to stay home and she did.,INTERVIEWER, The other defendant were you surprised that he got the same sentence as you?,INTERVIEWEE, No. We were co-defendants. And we were treated very similarly. And I was told that we would probably get identical sentences.,INTERVIEWER, What was your reaction when that juror did speak out in a way that seemed prejudicial?,INTERVIEWEE, Chappell Hatridge? It's quite obvious that he did perjure himself and that is one of the points in our appeal to have a juror who misleads in the process is dishonest.,INTERVIEWER, What was your reaction? How did you hear it by the way? Just watch the news?,INTERVIEWEE, Oh I watched him. He was the first one out the door to talk to the press. And it's disheartening. Because the judge was in such favor of the jury and had instructed them each and every day.,INTERVIEWER, This process taught you what?,INTERVIEWEE, Oh it's taught me a lot of things. And I think I'll write a book. Because I think it could be helpful to other people just about -- just about what lawyer to choose how to behave how to attend an interview. I mean there's things that you know there's no how-to book about this.,INTERVIEWER, No there ain't.,INTERVIEWEE, There isn't. Not that you know it's going to be a big bestseller. But for anybody who has to go through this process there should be some guidelines. Because guidelines would help.,INTERVIEWER, Was it a mistake some think it was a mistake to wear an expensive handbag.,INTERVIEWEE, Oh we're back to the handbag?,INTERVIEWER, I've never asked you about the handbag.,INTERVIEWEE, No you haven't. I don't mean you. But oh my gosh the newspapers and everything. And you know this case was not about a handbag. It was not about me testifying. The jury was clearly instructed about what the case was about.,INTERVIEWER, Donald Trump on this show said the night of the verdict that you should have testified. Because when a person is as big as you are in the public's eye and has been as public as you've been the public expects you and therefore the jury expects you.,INTERVIEWEE, Well Donald Trump has been a very big supporter and a very nice source of comfort for me. And I've known him for quite a few years. And what he says about that is his opinion. It was the opinion of my attorneys that I shouldn't testify and I listened to my attorneys.,INTERVIEWER, In retrospect do you regret it? In retrospect hindsight?,INTERVIEWEE, You know I don't know. I don't know if it would have changed the jury's verdict or not. I do not know. I can truthfully say that.,INTERVIEWER, Have you spoken to Sam Waksal by the way at all?,INTERVIEWEE, Have I spoken to him?,INTERVIEWER, Has he called you from jail?,INTERVIEWEE, I spoke to him once yes.,INTERVIEWER, How's he doing?,INTERVIEWEE, He seems to be OK. He said he's read 180 books and he's learned Italian.,INTERVIEWER, Is it kind of ironic to know that that stock is now doing very well?,INTERVIEWEE, No it's not at all ironic.,INTERVIEWER, If you had never had this never sold it never set that price you'd be ahead now right?,INTERVIEWEE, Well if I had held the stock down through $5 it went down to $5 you know.,INTERVIEWER, What's it now?,INTERVIEWEE, It's I think around $70 something. But that's good. But it's not about the price of the stock. It's about the drug. And that drug is a good drug it's saving lives it will save lives it's a cure for cancer. And what an admirable goal for someone to set for oneself and actually attain it even though you know it didn't work out for him.,INTERVIEWER, So you don't feel any irony in it from your own standpoint?,INTERVIEWEE, No.,INTERVIEWER, We're back with Martha Stewart. We'll go to some of your calls at the bottom of the hour. What did you mean by shameful?,INTERVIEWEE, Well it is shameful. It's shameful to me. I feel both shamed and that the situation for me was shameful for my family for my friends for my company. It's -- it's a word.,INTERVIEWER, How about the press and you? Especially some of the press. "The New York Post" has been very hard on you. Other tabloid media very difficult on you.,INTERVIEWEE, Well if you go to the Midwest there's none of those stories you know.,INTERVIEWER, So what do you think it is? You live in New York? You're an easy target?,INTERVIEWEE, I think that it sells newspapers. That's really -- that's it. And the stories are really something aren't they?,INTERVIEWER, Do you ever wonder why people like to see bad things happen to prominent people?,INTERVIEWEE, Well I've been told during this whole process that oh in America we like to build 'em up we like to break 'em down we like to see them suffer. We like to see success turn into failure. I don't. I am a hero worshiper. I love the number one tennis player. I love the number one baseball player. I want to see those records broken.,INTERVIEWER, You root for the Yankees.,INTERVIEWEE, Oh of course I'm a Yankee fan.,INTERVIEWER, Figures.,INTERVIEWEE, But don't hold that against me.,INTERVIEWER, I won't -- oh no no. Hey I like George.,INTERVIEWEE, No but see I have never felt that way. When someone is successful I just applaud. And if they're doing good things I applaud them even louder.,INTERVIEWER, How about an image that some people thought you arrogant?,INTERVIEWEE, Well again in my letter to the judge I said that...,INTERVIEWER, You've mentioned that.,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah I have been perceived as arrogant. And my explanation was that you know I work really really hard. I'm really hard on myself Larry. You know that. You know how many hours a day I put in at the job.,INTERVIEWER, You carry your own equipment.,INTERVIEWEE, Whatever.,INTERVIEWER, You do.,INTERVIEWEE, But I -- I have sometimes probably forgotten and I know I have forgotten to pat the back of someone or said thank you you know enough times or even maybe once sometimes. So I -- you know I wish I were perfect. I wish I were just you know the nicest nicest nicest person on Earth. But I'm a businessperson in addition to a creator of domestic arts. And it's an odd combination. No excuse. But if I were a man you know no one would say I was arrogant.,INTERVIEWER, You ever cry?,INTERVIEWEE, Of course I cry.,INTERVIEWER, Did you ever cry during this?,INTERVIEWEE, Only about other things. It's hard...,INTERVIEWER, You lost a friend to cancer.,INTERVIEWEE, Oh yeah Carolyn Kelly Wallach (ph). She died last week right during the worst week of this whole episode. And we went to her funeral. She had the most beautiful funeral. She has worked with me for about almost 17 years. She really helped shape the television program.,INTERVIEWER, Has a little son.,INTERVIEWEE, She has a son and two daughters. A wonderful husband. And I just can just pray that everything is OK.,INTERVIEWER, But nothing about this made you cry?,INTERVIEWEE, No. Because I -- I -- I'm sad rather than sobbing.,INTERVIEWER, What did you make of all the people writing to the judge and the people writing to the president?,INTERVIEWEE, The letters were phenomenally great.,INTERVIEWER, Are you surprised at all the attention this got? Are you surprised that you were front page?,INTERVIEWEE, Sometimes yes. Sometimes no. It depended on the day. But repetitious articles really got to me. The articles that just said the same thing over and over and over again. I don't know if the reading public wants to read the same thing over and over again. I certainly don't. I would rather read about something else. But again I think it's what sells newspapers.,INTERVIEWER, But you became on cable television as well day of sentencing day of verdict you were wall-to-wall.,INTERVIEWEE, Well I'd rather if my program was on television and people were watching me tell them how to bake a pie how to create a beautiful home how to make a wonderful garden. I cannot tell you how I long for that.,INTERVIEWER, We asked the former head of Enron the other night this question James Donovan said when he was secretary of labor in the Reagan administration and was charged with things and eventually exonerated on appeal. He said where do I go to get my name back?,INTERVIEWEE, Well that's a famous quote.,INTERVIEWER, Where do you go?,INTERVIEWEE, Well I hope my name is still intact. I hope it is. I hope our brand is still the brand Martha Stewart. I think it is. The products have not changed Larry. The magazines are as good as they ever were. The products are still beautiful and useful and high quality.,INTERVIEWER, Are they selling?,INTERVIEWEE, Oh yes. They are.,INTERVIEWER, You're still with Kmart? ,INTERVIEWEE, Oh yes. Of course.,INTERVIEWER, That's been renewed.,INTERVIEWEE, Oh yeah.,INTERVIEWER, So what went down? The magazine circulation went down?,INTERVIEWEE, Well advertising went down. And as a result of advertising pages -- a lot of advertisers had to take a wait-and-see attitude. And I thank the advertisers who stayed. I thank the advertisers who will come back in force I hope. It's the same beautiful product.,INTERVIEWER, And back to the initial thing we talked about if you serve now they might come back tomorrow?,INTERVIEWEE, I wish they could tell me.,INTERVIEWER, Miss Stewart I want to tell you that I admire you very very much and don't give those people satisfaction who seem to need to see you on your hands and knees with tears streaming down your face. You're much stronger than that. You don't need to do it. And the people who recognize people who work hard and know how hard you've worked to build up your company don't need to see you do that. And Mr. King I'd like to say to you that I think it's very ironic that Friday night on your show you had Henry Blodget commented on Miss Stewart's case. Didn't he have to leave his job for some securities fraud himself? So you know that goes to show you the world we live in.,INTERVIEWEE, He was on the show yes.,INTERVIEWER, Do you have a question for Martha ma'am? I just wanted to tell her to keep her head up high and also to ask her how is Mr. Bacanovic doing?,INTERVIEWEE, He's saddened as I am. And I...,INTERVIEWER, Have you spoken to him?,INTERVIEWEE, I have yes. And he is raising an appeal right now also.,INTERVIEWER, And he intends to go through with the appeal?,INTERVIEWEE, I think so.,INTERVIEWER, Or you may serve too?,INTERVIEWEE, I don't know.,INTERVIEWER, McKinleyville California. Hello. Hi. I just want to tell Martha how much I love her for years and now my 4-year-old granddaughter is a fan also. We watch her every day. And I always learn something new. Now I heard your show is going to be taken off the air. And I don't think we can live without it because we have Halloween and Christmas and every day things to learn from. So what can we do?,INTERVIEWEE, Well you can write to your stations...,INTERVIEWER, This is radio show?,INTERVIEWEE, No this is both. The radio is off. The television is off. But our programming will be on the air on the Style Network. They will not be -- it won't be original programming for the next season but it will be wonderful wonderful compilations of past seasons. So please watch it on the Style Network.,INTERVIEWER, That's a cable network?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, The Style Network?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, When you say you feel like you're part of the holidays in America. I mean that's what she asked. You always visited our show.,INTERVIEWEE, Oh I did always.,INTERVIEWER, Flushing Ohio hello. Hi. Yes this is Ashley. And I was wondering how Alexis is doing? I heard that she fainted in the courtroom and I was very concerned about that. And I'm just so concerned about you and your company and all that. And I watch the news all the time and I see you and I just feel so sorry for you.,INTERVIEWEE, Well thank you.,INTERVIEWER, And what about like I hear like you are appealing and all this. What if you are sentenced to prison? You know you'll have a felony and you can't run your company. You know...First Alexis is fine. She's here tonight. She looks great by the way.,INTERVIEWEE, Alexis joined me tonight and she's OK. I -- well if I...,INTERVIEWER, Can you continue to run a company?,INTERVIEWEE, From jail?,INTERVIEWER, No with a felony conviction can you run a company that's listed on the board? I guess you can.,INTERVIEWEE, Well that's yet to be determined legally. But I will remain very active in our company. And I will hopefully be able to start producing television again when this is all over which I hope is over as soon as possible. And thank you for your concern is.,INTERVIEWER, Can you run things from prison? Being logical can you?,INTERVIEWEE, I don't think so no. I don't think so. I don't think that's...,INTERVIEWER, You're allowed calls?,INTERVIEWEE, But you're not allowed to talk about business. This is one thing I did learn.,INTERVIEWER, Oh you can't talk about business?,INTERVIEWEE, No.,INTERVIEWER, You once said business is your life.,INTERVIEWEE, My life is my business and my business is my life.,INTERVIEWER, Isn't that kind of sad in a way? I mean I know you love it and everything.,INTERVIEWEE, Sad?,INTERVIEWER, Your life is your business?,INTERVIEWEE, Well my business encompasses a lot of things that I do. I mean all the things I love is what my business is all about. So that's not sad. It's about child raising it's about home keeping. It's about gardening entertaining cooking. All the things that I'm really interested in the domestic arts. So you know I met your little boys and I mean they're part of what I do. Children. We have a magazine called "Kids" Larry that kids use all the projects in the magazine. They told me.,INTERVIEWER, That's right. Everybody I know my whole family is involved with you.,INTERVIEWEE, They are very charming little boys too I must tell you. It's the first time I've met them and they're wonderful.,INTERVIEWER, Sacramento hello. Yes Martha I would like to ask you if you do have to do jail time and you come out do you -- will you bring some of your ideas from jail to your show? And will you do your show again yourself or will someone else do it?,INTERVIEWEE, Wouldn't it really be better if I could take my ideas from my show to jail I think that that might be a better thing.,INTERVIEWER, People make jokes you're going to redo the jail.,INTERVIEWEE, Larry it's not a joking matter.,INTERVIEWER, No it's not.,INTERVIEWEE, It's not.,INTERVIEWER, Do you fear it?,INTERVIEWEE, Sure.,INTERVIEWER, What do you fear the most?,INTERVIEWEE, I mean I'm not afraid to go to jail. I'm afraid to be incarcerated. I mean it's a lack of freedom. My freedom is taken away. Anybody in their right mind would fear incarceration. But the thing of going into a jail doesn't -- I mean I'm not so afraid of that.,INTERVIEWER, Do you have thoughts as to how you might be treated?,INTERVIEWEE, No not yet. I think I have to do some research.,INTERVIEWER, Which knowing you you will. You'll...,INTERVIEWEE, Well you have to. I mean it would be silly not to don't you think?,INTERVIEWER, Did the judge make any recommendations as to where? Do you have a preference as to where?,INTERVIEWEE, She actually asked me where and I asked her for Danbury which she recommended. Because Danbury is close to my mom who's going to turn 90 in September. And so that would be a convenient place she could actually come and visit me. And it's convenient to New York City. There are other places but very far away.,INTERVIEWER, How was your probation officer?,INTERVIEWEE, A very nice man. Very nice man.,INTERVIEWER, He was -- did he spend a lot of time with you? Did he do a thorough report? You don't get to see that report do you?,INTERVIEWEE, Oh yes I do.,INTERVIEWER, You do?,INTERVIEWEE, Oh yes. It's called a presence sentencing report. They have a job to do. They do their research. They do a very thorough job and ask many many many questions. But it's just like a research project.,INTERVIEWER, Do you have -- are you very confident in your appeals attorney who was on this program I think?,INTERVIEWEE, Oh yes. Walter Dellinger and Marty Weinberg David Chesnoff there's a team.,INTERVIEWER, They're separate from the trial attorneys that's specialist.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes. And they will be mounting the appeal. They filed for the appeal on last Friday. So it's in the process.,INTERVIEWER, You'll be 63-years-old...,INTERVIEWEE, Oh!,INTERVIEWER, ... in August. Oh! You feel it?,INTERVIEWEE, No. No.,INTERVIEWER, You never felt older did you? ,INTERVIEWEE, No. I didn't. I don't.,INTERVIEWER, Do you -- you look at your life what you've become -- I mean this little girl from little town.,INTERVIEWEE, Look at you. Who's talking.,INTERVIEWER, Well I'm leading up to something. I pinch myself every day. I pinch myself every day. I consider myself lucky.,INTERVIEWEE, Well sure you are lucky. I'm lucky.,INTERVIEWER, Any successful...,INTERVIEWEE, And I'm just having an unlucky period right now.,INTERVIEWER, That's the way to look at it right?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, Because Paul Newman once said any successful person who doesn't use the word luck is lying.,INTERVIEWEE, Well I've usually been in the right place at the right time.,INTERVIEWER, That's right. Things happen to lucky people.,INTERVIEWEE, Mm-hmm. Well things happen to everyone. And like my friend Carolyn I said in my letter to the judge Carolyn can no longer dream create do. I can. Right?,INTERVIEWER, Yes. So you consider yourself blessed?,INTERVIEWEE, Of course I'm blessed. Not right this minute. Generally very blessed.,INTERVIEWER, We're back with Martha Stewart. By the way is there an heir apparent? Is there someone in the wings who in case you don't run the company will run the company?,INTERVIEWEE, Oh the company is very well run. We have a whole management team there that is doing as good a job as I could hope for under the circumstances. And so the company the brand can certainly exist without me. It's been designed to exist without me.,INTERVIEWER, Is there -- have you seen another Martha Stewart on the horizon?,INTERVIEWEE, Well I'm always looking.,INTERVIEWER, Are you?,INTERVIEWEE, Oh yes. And I -- you know you think you have somebody in mind not just to replace me because you don't want to replace yourself. You want to build another person. Or another group of people.,INTERVIEWER, Sure.,INTERVIEWEE, I mean if -- the one way to grow our company is to grow more brands around other people. We have Marc Marone (ph) our pet- keeping guy. We're working with him very closely on a lot of things. We have our "Everyday Food" magazine now.,INTERVIEWER, So you wouldn't mind if another woman emerged in the company and got well-known?,INTERVIEWEE, Absolutely not. I might be able to take a vacation.,INTERVIEWER, Downey California. Hello. Thanks for taking my call. First Martha I've never bought a magazine from you I never saw your shows but I am totally in awe of how well you handled yourself and you are an inspiration. I know what you feel like I think. I had a similar situation. My question to you is -- but I will buy your magazine. I will support.,INTERVIEWEE, Thank you very much. I'm just so sorry that happened to you. My question is when that movie with Cybill Shepherd portraying your life did that hurt you very badly?, All those things that are so exaggerated and so almost parody-like hurt a little bit. And especially when they bring up things in the past and quotes from people who haven't seen me in 17 to 20 years. There's nothing fresh in those shows. Nothing. And I always like to say I'd rather do my own show.,INTERVIEWER, Was it weird to see yourself played?,INTERVIEWEE, I didn't watch the whole show.,INTERVIEWER, You didn't?,INTERVIEWEE, No. No! I couldn't.,INTERVIEWER, You were bored?, INTERVIEWEE, No. I mean it's similar in a way you know. Cybill Shepherd with a tire around her waist you know trying to look really fat. Maybe you know -- no I can't watch things like that. I just can't.,INTERVIEWER, Do you read bad stories?,INTERVIEWEE, About me?,INTERVIEWER, Yes.,INTERVIEWEE, Well I try to read keep current with what the press is saying just in case I meet somebody on the street some day.,INTERVIEWER, Even if it's vicious you read it?,INTERVIEWEE, Well yes. Not with any sense of enjoyment by the way.,INTERVIEWER, Of course.,INTERVIEWEE, Of course not.,INTERVIEWER, To Mesa Arizona. Hello. Mesa are you there? Yes hello. Go ahead. Hi. How many employees have lost their jobs with your company since this has started?,INTERVIEWEE, In 2001 we had about 650 employees. And as a result of this situation and just some other -- and the Internet crisis we have about 470 employees now. So quite a few have lost their jobs. But I must say that I'm so sorry for all that. This has been a very painful experience for those people for their families and of course for me.,INTERVIEWER, Did you have normally a lot of longevity at the company?,INTERVIEWEE, Oh we do we do. Many people who are in the management of the company have been with me since we started the magazine. And they're still there. And they're terrific people and we have a lot of that yes.,INTERVIEWER, You still do catering?,INTERVIEWEE, No! No.,INTERVIEWER, Monterey California. Hello. Hello. My question is about the house arrest portion. If she does serve prison and then has five months of house arrest is she allowed to run her company then?,INTERVIEWEE, Oh.,INTERVIEWER, Good question.,INTERVIEWEE, OK. Well I will be able to work.,INTERVIEWER, Out of the house.,INTERVIEWEE, On house arrest. I was granted I think 48 hours a week out of the house.,INTERVIEWER, Where you can go to work.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes. So that's good.,INTERVIEWER, So you can work. And you can run the company.,INTERVIEWEE, Well run the company. Work at the company. Whatever it is.,INTERVIEWER, I guess one of the more curious aspects of the trial is Marianna Pasternak. Your friend travel with you testified against you and then on cross-examination seemed to say that she didn't remember. What did you make of all that? What was it like for you to sit and listen to all of that?,INTERVIEWEE, That gets pretty close to the case so I really am not going to comment on that.,INTERVIEWER, OK then I'll ask emotionally was it difficult to hear a friend talk?,INTERVIEWEE, Let's say that her two daughters are my godchildren. It's pretty hard to see the whole -- the whole thing.,INTERVIEWER, Do you know your friends in a case like this?,INTERVIEWEE, Do any of us know our friends in a case like this?,INTERVIEWER, You would think that you'd get to know those who support you and those who cross the street when you walk.,INTERVIEWEE, I have so many really nice friends Larry and I am very grateful for that. They have been very supportive. I have friends who call me each and every day to make sure I'm feeling OK. I have friends to have dinner with on a daily basis. No problem at all.,INTERVIEWER, Why have you been very public?,INTERVIEWEE, What do you mean?,INTERVIEWER, You go to Yankee games. You go to museums. You go out to dinner. In other words you're not hiding.,INTERVIEWEE, Well... ,INTERVIEWER, A lot of people in that position would you know walk quietly into the night and I'll see you later.,INTERVIEWEE, For 2 1/2 years? At my time of life? With the things I want to do and the things I want to see and learn? I can't hole myself up. I wouldn't. I wouldn't think of it. It's not -- it's not the way I am.,INTERVIEWER, All right maybe the most difficult thing of all. What was it like to have to be quiet publicly?,INTERVIEWEE, Difficult. You know that.,INTERVIEWER, You're a public person.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes. And I'm a communicator.,INTERVIEWER, And a media person.,INTERVIEWEE, And I am a media person. And I am a journalist and I am you know a visible person.,INTERVIEWER, Mm-hmm.,INTERVIEWEE, Being on television so many times a week with programming. On the radio every day. And newspaper columns. All of that...,INTERVIEWER, So what was it like to not have it?,INTERVIEWEE, Well that didn't stop. What stopped was I wasn't able to speak on my behalf. Because that is part of the legal system and the legal way in this country. So when you are you know when you are embroiled in a situation like this you are advised not to speak about the case.,INTERVIEWER, But look how frustrating that is.,INTERVIEWEE, Oh you would be very frustrated. Everyone would be frustrated. Because you want people to know what you think what the truth is. You want to tell them everything. And you just can't speak about it. Because anything you say might be held against you.,INTERVIEWER, By the way because of her pending appeal Martha is -- there were things she was unable to talk about tonight specifics of the legal case. We had one item come up that she explained. And she's also speaking for herself not for Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia. And we go to Lakeland Florida. Hello. Martha I've been following your story on MJ (ph) morning show and wanted to know how your mother is handling the ordeal?,INTERVIEWEE, Mom is strong 89-year-old. And it's very hard on her. But she has a great support group at her church at her senior center. She swims at the Y every other day. And she's still driving herself around and coping.,INTERVIEWER, She's a nice lady.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes she is a very nice lady.,INTERVIEWER, Nashville Tennessee hello. Hello Larry. Thank you for taking my call. Martha it's an honor to speak to you. My question is what do you feel is the biggest misconception the public has about you or doesn't know about you? Good question.,INTERVIEWEE, Well I think that -- I think that there have been so many kind of misrepresentations of me. And...,INTERVIEWER, What's the biggest misconception do you think?,INTERVIEWEE, Meany!,INTERVIEWER, Meany.,INTERVIEWEE, I'm a softie.,INTERVIEWER, How did that begin?,INTERVIEWEE, I don't know.,INTERVIEWER, Where did that start?,INTERVIEWEE, Where does stuff like that start? I don't know.,INTERVIEWER, Maybe it's because you're a perfectionist. And perfectionists can get labeled meany because they'll say move that tray right?,INTERVIEWEE, Well...,INTERVIEWER, Are you a perfectionist?,INTERVIEWEE, I am a perfectionist. But I want to make sure that everybody understands that I'm not personally perfect. How's that?,INTERVIEWER, You're not a perfect person?,INTERVIEWEE, No. Are you?,INTERVIEWER, No. No but I mean but you...,INTERVIEWEE, But I never said I was perfect. I've always said I was a perfectionist because I'm a teacher. And if teachers don't do it well who's going to listen to you? Do you want to see me make that flop cake? No. I'm not a comedian. I am a teacher.,INTERVIEWER, Are you very judgmental?,INTERVIEWEE, No I don't know. I don't know if that's really the right word. Teachers teachers want to see their students perform as well or better than they. And I love a student that does things better than I do.,INTERVIEWER, You do?,INTERVIEWEE, Oh yes. That's what you look for. You look when you're a teacher that's -- you're hoping always for somebody who comes along and does it better than you do it. And I always -- I celebrate that. I certainly wouldn't malign it.,INTERVIEWER, You're very hands-on though right?,INTERVIEWEE, Oh yeah.,INTERVIEWER, Was it difficult for you therefore to be told what to do by lawyers?,INTERVIEWEE, Oh yeah.,INTERVIEWER, Because you want to run the show?,INTERVIEWEE, Well...,INTERVIEWER, You're used to running the show.,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah but I'm not a lawyer. And you know I took advice. I made up my mind that I would take the advice of the best lawyers I could find. And that's it.,INTERVIEWER, All right. What kept you going through it all?,INTERVIEWEE, My work. My ideas. My creativity. My family. My friends. The constant evolutionary work of our company. I have all that. That's what's so good. That's my support system.,INTERVIEWER, And how about the days you were in court though? Couldn't run the company those days you had to be in court all day right?,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah. It's a real challenge to set your mind on something else. Something else that oh is sometimes so mind- boggling. And it was mind-boggling.,INTERVIEWER, Now what was it like to know every time you step out of a car they're all looking at you? INTERVIEWEE, Well you know in New York unless there are photographers who are like pushing at you and stuff with the cameras everybody the truck drivers the cab drivers the passersby on the street have all been so nice. Really nice. Really supportive., You haven't run into any situation where someone has accosted you?,INTERVIEWEE, No.,INTERVIEWER, Come up to you on the street and yelled at you?,INTERVIEWEE, Not once Larry. And that's what's so nice. And that's what keeps me going that I know that I have friends out there.,INTERVIEWER, We only have about 30 seconds left. But when will you be making this decision do you know about serving not serving?,INTERVIEWEE, I don't know. Don't know. It's a big decision. Can't rush it.,INTERVIEWER, Thank you for coming Martha.,INTERVIEWEE, Thank you. And you're a good friend.,INTERVIEWER, I appreciate your coming.,INTERVIEWEE, Thank you.,INTERVIEWER, Martha Stewart. On Friday she was sentenced to five months in prison and five months confinement two years probation after that and fined $30000. You don't pay that yet do you?,INTERVIEWEE, I haven't no. I was waiting for them to ask me for it. But -- I'm not joking about it.,INTERVIEWER, OK no jokes.,INTERVIEWEE, I owe it., INTERVIEWER, Patti Smith welcome back to FRESH AIR. It's in New York that you met Robert Mapplethorpe and you know you changed the course of each other's lives. Would you tell the story of how you met Robert Mapplethorpe?,INTERVIEWEE, Well our - my first meeting was very simple. I had some friends at Pratt Institute people that went to my high school that had the means to go to art school. And I - I was looking for them hoping for a little shelter since I had nowhere to sleep that night. But when I went to visit them they had moved and the boy that answered the door didn't know where my friends had moved and said well go in there and maybe my roommate will know where they are. And I went in a room and there was a boy sleeping lying on a little iron bed and just with a mass of dark curls. And as soon as I walked in he awoke and looked at me and smiled. And then I talked and he knew where my friends had lived. But the thing that I remember the very first impression I have of Robert is waking up and smiling.,INTERVIEWER, At some point you realize that Mapplethorpe was gay. At some point he realized that he was gay. How did it affect his relationship with you? When he came to terms with being gay and had lovers and eventually had a long-time lover were you able to stay as close even though the relationship had changed?,INTERVIEWEE, Oh Robert and I always were just as close. I mean we had to work out obviously the physical aspect of our relationship. And it was really me who in the end severed the physical aspect of our relationship. You know and in the end we worked that out. I mean because we were so close and our love for each other was so deep that the absence of - and we were still physical with one another. He was always very affectionate. Till the day he died we were still affectionate toward one another.,INTERVIEWER, In your book you write about how Mapplethorpe's work started to change and become more sadomasochistic in its imagery which he became quite famous for. And you write that that imagery was bewildering and frightening to you. You write he couldn't share things with me because it was so outside our realm and that you couldn't comprehend the brutality of his images of self-inflicted pain. It was hard for you to match it with the boy you had met. Can you talk a little bit about - a little bit more about your reaction to his images and what you found disturbing and incomprehensible about it?,INTERVIEWEE, Well they were disturbing images.,INTERVIEWER, They're meant to be disturbing yeah right.,INTERVIEWEE, I'm just - I mean Robert - I mean a lot of my reaction was out of first of all naietivity (ph). I didn't know anything about that world. I still know very little about that world. And my protective instincts for Robert - they frightened me. I worried that he would be hurt or something bad would happen to him. But he was - always assured me that all of these situations were controlled consensual situations. I mean there were a few of these images that I thought were actually brilliant. And so we were able after I processed the subject matter to talk to - to talk about these images as art. But I was never really curious to talk about them in any other way. And he respected that.,INTERVIEWER, You say that until a friend suggested that you be in a rock 'n' roll band it had never occurred to you. It was just like not part of your world.,INTERVIEWEE, No why would it? You know I'm not a musician. You know I didn't play any instrument. I didn't have any specific talents. I mean I came from the South Jersey-Philadelphia area. And in early '60s everybody sang. They sang on street corners three-part harmonies a cappella. Most of my friends were better singers than me. There was nothing in what I did that would give a sense that I should be in a rock 'n' roll band. Also girls weren't in rock 'n' roll bands. I mean they sang but you know the closest thing to a rock singer a real rock singer that we had was Grace Slick and I certainly didn't have Grace Slick's voice.,INTERVIEWER, You were saying that you didn't have - you know you didn't think of yourself as a singer per se that your friends had better voices than you did. But you created this new style really that was a combination of poetry and music. It wasn't about having like a perfect singer's voice. It was the style that you performed and the personality that you put into it - the kind of defiance that you had in some songs the energy. Would you talk about what you felt you were doing early on that was different from what you'd seen other people do?,INTERVIEWEE, I think my perception of myself was really as a performer and a communicator. I had a mission when we recorded "Horses." My mission was...,INTERVIEWER, It was your first album.,INTERVIEWEE, My first album "Horses" my mission and the collective band mission was really on one level to merge poetry and rock 'n' roll but more humanistically to reach out to other disenfranchised people. In 1975 the you know young homosexual kids were you know being disowned by their families. The kids were you know kids like me who were a little weird or a little different were often persecuted in their small towns. And it wasn't just you know because of sexual persuasion. It was for any reason - for being an artist for being different for having political views for just wanting to be free. And I really recorded the record to connect with these people you know and also in terms of our place in rock 'n' roll just to create some bridge between our great artists that we had just lost - Jimi Hendrix and Jim Morrison among them - and to create space for what I felt would be the new guard which I didn't really include myself. I was really anticipating people or bands like The Clash and The Ramones. I was anticipating in my mind that a new breed would come - Television - a new breed would come and they would be less materialistic more bonded with the people and not so glamorous. I wasn't thinking so much of music. I wasn't thinking so much of perfection or stardom or any of that stuff. I was thinking - I had this mission and I thought I would do this record and then go back to my writing and my drawing and you know return to my you know my somewhat abnormal normal life. But "Horses" took me on a whole different path.,INTERVIEWER, Is there a track from "Horses" that particularly illustrates what you were describing as what your mission was?,INTERVIEWEE, "Birdland.",INTERVIEWER, OK.,INTERVIEWEE, I think "Birdland" because - for various reasons. "Birdland" was an improvisation built on an improvisation. It so much exemplifies the communication of my band especially between Richard Lenny and I. And it speaks of this new breed you know the new generations who will be dreaming in animation you know the new generations that will race across the fields no longer presidents but prophets. That - it's - that was my - it was like my telegram to the new breed.,INTERVIEWER, Robert Mapplethorpe did the very iconic photograph for the cover of "Horses." Would you briefly describe the photo?,INTERVIEWEE, Well it's very classic photograph by Robert very simple. I'm standing against a white wall with a triangular shadow dressed in the clothes typical of myself then. And just an old white shirt - a clean old white shirt - sort of a black ribbon that symbolizes a tie or a cravat black pants jacket's slung over my shoulder looking directly at Robert. It's - has a little bit of Baudelaire a little bit of Catholic boy a little bit of Frank Sinatra and a lot of Robert.,INTERVIEWER,  What impact do you think that photo had on how people perceived you?,INTERVIEWEE, Well I - you know I don't know. I (laughter) I know people really liked it. I know the record company didn't.,INTERVIEWER, They didn't? That's such a great photo. Why didn't the record company like it?,INTERVIEWEE, 'Cause my hair was messy because you know it just - it was a little incomprehensible to them at the time. But I fought for it and they did try to airbrush my hair but I made sure that was fixed. People were very upset constantly about my appearance when I was young. I don't know what it was. You know they just - it was very hard for them to factor. But I've always had that problem even as a child. You know I used to go to the beach when I was a little kid and just want to wear my dungarees and my flannel shirt. And the whole time people would be why are you wearing that? Why don't you get a bathing suit you know why are - it's like leave me alone. (Laughter). It's just like I'm not bothering you. Why are you worried about you know what I look like you know? It's just - I'm not trying to bother anybody. But people loved the photograph. The people on the streets loved the photograph. And it gave Robert some instant attention. I think it was his you know the - where he - it really helped you know launch his work into the public consciousness. And so we were both very happy about that. And the funniest thing and sort of the sweetest thing was when I started performing after the record came out I would go to clubs anywhere - it could be Denmark it could be in Youngstown Ohio - and I would come on stage and at least half of the kids had white shirts and black ties on. It was kind of cool. We were all - we all had suddenly turned Catholic.,INTERVIEWER, You write that you know when Mapplethorpe died of AIDS in March of '89 the morning that he died you describe your feelings. And you say that you were shuddering overwhelmed by a sense of excitement acceleration as if because of the closeness that you experienced with Robert you were to be privy to his new adventure - the miracle of his death. You say this wild sensation stayed with you for some days. Could you describe that? Did you know he was dying when you - did - had you gotten the phone call when you felt this or were you just feeling this you know without even...,INTERVIEWEE, No I felt that after he died.,INTERVIEWER, After he died.,INTERVIEWEE, I had already received the call that he had died. I mean we knew that he was dying. We knew that he was dying the last couple of weeks of his life. I talked to him. I talked to Robert in the last hour that he could still speak and I listened to his breathing before I went to sleep. His brother called me and let me listen to his breathing and he died that morning. So that sensation that I felt was his you know acceleration into his next place after death. I could really feel that. I've experienced a lot of death since Robert. I sat with Allen Ginsberg when he died. I was with my husband when he died my parents. But Robert - the acceleration in energy I felt after Robert's death was unique and it did stay with me for quite a while. And I think that each of us - you know our energy leaves in a different way according to the person - you know according to the energy of the person the way the spirit manifests. Each of us die differently. And we have - you know I believe that - I believe we all have a unique journey whether it's a journey of pure energy if there's any intelligence within the journey. But I think each of us have our own way of dissipating or entering a new field.,INTERVIEWER, You say that one of the people who you were with when he died was Allen Ginsberg and in your memoir you mention some advice that Ginsberg had given you after your husband died. He said let go of the spirit of the departed and continue your life's celebration. Having experienced as much death as you have is that good advice do you think?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes. I mean I think that you know there - the idea that time heals all wounds is not really true. Our wounds aren't really ever healed. We just learn to walk with them. We learn that some days we're going to feel intense pain all over again. And we just have to say OK I know you; you can come along with me today in the same way that sometimes we start laughing at - in the middle of nowhere remembering something that happened with someone we've lost. And you know life is the best thing that we have. We each have a life. We have to negotiate it navigate it. And I think it's very important that we enjoy our life that we get everything we can out of it. And it doesn't take away from our love of the departed. I mean I take Fred along with me in the things that I do or Robert or my father or my mother. You know whoever wants to come along they can be with me and - you know and if I want them I can sense them. You know we have our own life but we can still walk with the people that we miss or that we lose. And I think it's very important to not be afraid to experience joy in the middle of sorrow because you know that's what our life is. You know our art it's the fearful symmetry of Blake - you know joy and sorrow. You don't want to just feel one of them. They're both valuable to the spirit.,INTERVIEWER, Patti Smith thank you so much for talking with us.,INTERVIEWEE, Oh you're welcome. Nice to talk to you too.,INTERVIEWER, We are so happy for her because she's a great person and so many good thing happening. The trade paperback of her book "The Funny Thing is" the "New York Times" best seller will be out shortly. She host the Emmy Award winning show going in it's second season just started the second season. It got more em my nominations than any other time. A total of 12. Ellen -- are you a comedian who does a talk show. Are you a -- or talk show host who writes? What are you?,INTERVIEWEE, That's the question. What am I? If we could just get to the bottom of that. You know I don't even think of myself as a comedian. I mean that would be the job...,INTERVIEWER, No.,INTERVIEWEE, No. I didn't start out thinking I'm a comedian. I don't think I fit that bill. I'm not on all the time and I don't really care about being on stage all the time.,INTERVIEWER, So what then was your goal?,INTERVIEWEE, To earn a living you know. I didn't know what else to do. I was struggling I was young I had nothing going on. I was a waitress and shucked oysters and I sold vacuum cleaners and I painted houses and hated what I was doing. And I hated working and I needed money. And I was funny around my friends and they asked me to perform at a benefit I did. And someone saw me there and asked me play at college. And someone saw me there. And all of a sudden I was working coffee houses. There wasn't even a comedy club. ,INTERVIEWER, What do the folks at home think?,INTERVIEWEE, The folks at home being the people in New Orleans?,INTERVIEWER, Yes.,INTERVIEWEE, I think they would be shocked to see how far I've come. I mean everyone that new me growing -- I didn't seem like -- I wasn't the class clown. I wasn't popular. I wasn't outgoing. And this is fluke to me even. I hadn't -- I could never have imagine in my life doing this.,INTERVIEWER, What was -- what was your break? How did we know your name? How did you come to our attention?,INTERVIEWEE, The first time probably people really were aware of me I unfortunately had the title of Showtimes Funniest Person America. And that's a really tough title to travel around with when you're not even known.,INTERVIEWER, And you were doing stand up?,INTERVIEWEE, I was doing stand-up. And I won -- all these people entered...,INTERVIEWER, Like a comedy contest?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes it wasn't like me and Robin Williams or anything. It's like I won against people that were you know in mine league. And so I was traveling around and somebody would see the funniest person in America is appearing at Chuckles and you know the mini-mall. And they'd walk in and of course be disappointed.,INTERVIEWER, Before we talk let's talk about the talk show first. How did that come about you hosting a talk show?,INTERVIEWEE, When I was doing "Ellen" when I was doing that sitcom years ago I was approached by two different companies saying when this show finishes would you like to host a talk show. And Rosie O'Donnell had just got a show at the time and I think somebody else had just gotten a show. A lot of people were doing talk shows. And I said no because I just felt like -- it would look like one more person doing a show. And so I thought I would wait. And then of course when the show was canceled nobody was offering me anything. Everything was gone. Then I did another sitcom and that failed and it looked like it was failing and a couple of companies came and said if this fails do you want to do a talk show? And I said yes I have nothing else to do. It was my last chance to do anything.,INTERVIEWER, But in the middle of all this you had "Finding Nemo" an enormous hit for you.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, Wasn't it? So it wasn't all downside.,INTERVIEWEE, But that I had been doing that for three years and I didn't know when that was coming. That happened to come out right before the talk show started. So it was just the timing of it all was beautiful. I mean you know I couldn't have planned it any better. But When i started doing "Nemo" I wasn't working. I was doing nothing. I did "Nemo" then I did a sitcom that didn't last and then I did this.,INTERVIEWER, And also we were talking before the show about doing -- having been in "Shrek 2." You never saw Albert Brooks? You never were with him?,INTERVIEWEE, Nobody in the movie. I was by myself in a -- I hope I'm not the only one that was like that. I hope they made everyone do it that way. That would be sad to find out I was the only one that did that. percent.,INTERVIEWER, I'm sure they did. But you never were with your mate?,INTERVIEWEE, No my mate.,INTERVIEWER, Albert Brooks was your...,INTERVIEWEE, Yes well. Yes. He wasn't really my mate. But yes Albert Brooks and I never worked together until -- we saw each other at the premier. It was weird.,INTERVIEWER, You must have flipped though how they did it put it together.,INTERVIEWEE, Well I knew -- I mean it was a Pixar film and they do such beautiful work so I knew it was going to turn out to be a good movie. I had no idea that it would end up doing what it did and that Dory would be a character that people would love so much.,INTERVIEWER, Could be another one?,INTERVIEWEE, I don't think so. I don't think Disney and Pixar can come to an agreement. So since they can't I don't think there be a...,INTERVIEWER, That would have worked see. Like "Shrek 2" worked that would have worked.,INTERVIEWEE, Believe me.,INTERVIEWER, It's an institution.,INTERVIEWEE, It was disappointing to me. I was planning on doing Dory again.,INTERVIEWER, OK the talk shows come about. Now how did you conceive it. What was Ellen DeGeneres going to do that 15 other people didn't do?,INTERVIEWEE, I didn't think about it I really didn't. Everybody said what are you going to do that's different and these things failed. They told me the demographic of who watches a daytime television show this is what appeals to them. It's like you know here's the thing I'm out of options now. You know it seems like the sitcom isn't going to work for me. I'm just going to be myself. I'm going to do what I -- you know whatever -- I'm going to think on my feet. I'm going to talk to people and have a conversation with people and hopefully ask different kinds of questions than other talk shows. I'll try to do something different and have it a happy positive show everyday.,INTERVIEWER, Did guesting on other shows through your career help? Did you use things you learned by being asked questions?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, Are people good and bad at it?,INTERVIEWEE, I mean like talking to you is very you know it's a conversation. I don't feel like I'm -- this is prepared it's just going where it's going to go. Johnny Carson was amazing. To be on Johnny Carson to be fortunate to be on that before he retired was amazing. There are shows you as you know that people are not paying attention. And if you are not paying attention you can't...,INTERVIEWER, Follow up.,INTERVIEWEE, You can't -- yes you can't catch a joke. You can't -- and you can't -- and it doesn't make the person feel comfortable because you know they're not listening.,INTERVIEWER, Did you think it would work?,INTERVIEWEE, You know Yes.,INTERVIEWER, Did you have confidence?,INTERVIEWEE, Sure but maybe that was naive because Everybody is so surprised. Like you know can you believe it worked? It's like I wouldn't have done it if you know.,INTERVIEWER, Odds were against you right.,INTERVIEWEE, Gods are against you...,INTERVIEWER, Most new daytime talk shows fail. ,INTERVIEWEE, Yes but most people fail in this business. Most comedians fail. I can't look at my life and what could possibly go wrong. I can only look at it in -- you know here's what I see. Here's my goal and that's the only thing I see.,INTERVIEWER, How involved in the show are you? Is it hands on? Are you selecting guests?,INTERVIEWEE, I don't select guests. You know I mean most of them are just the third caller. We just take whoever calls in. You know I'm more hands on than any other show I've ever done. Sitcoms I just kind of -- I'd show up and I would Imbruglia every once in a while. But this show every segment everything we do the set everything is -- I make digs decisions on.,INTERVIEWER, Were you surprised at what happened with it?,INTERVIEWEE, I don't...,INTERVIEWER, You didn't know what to expect. But -- what 12 Emmy nominations were you surprised?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes and I didn't know at the time 12 was a big deal. I was like oh that's great. And then I found out there was one we weren't nominated for and I...,INTERVIEWER, What was that?,INTERVIEWEE, Best song. And of course my reaction was oh that's great 12. Mine's like what's wrong with our song you know. I'm like I want everything. I think I'm surprised by the fact that where I am right now. I've really come to a really good place in my life. And it's amazing this show helped turn it around. And so I'm surprised it had such an impact on how people respond.,INTERVIEWER, Because some might have bet that a controversial host and you certainly had your share of controversy would have been a mark against it succeeding.,INTERVIEWEE, Sure. A lot of the stations...,INTERVIEWER, The most controversial Rosie got the less successful her show got.,INTERVIEWEE, You know and here's the thing I don't really think I'm controversial. And I think what I did was controversial. And I think that you know anytime you announce something about yourself especially when it's not socially accepted and people don't understand it that's controversial. I've never been political I've never really been outspoken. I'm a comedian who happens to be gay. And that became a big deal and it over shadowed everything else in my life and in my career and everything I'd worked for. And there were a lot of station managers that were afraid to buy the show because they thought she's going to talk about being gay. The whole things going to be about -- it's going to be political. It's like if you watch any of my stand-up specials nothing is about that.,INTERVIEWER, In fact your show doesn't have an agenda so to speak you're not there to prove a point.,INTERVIEWEE, Never -- my only thing is I wanted to get beyond that. That's all I've ever wanted to do. That was -- no.,INTERVIEWER, What does that have to do with a talk show? What's with the dancing?,INTERVIEWEE, You know here's what happened.,INTERVIEWER, OK.,INTERVIEWEE, I didn't want band. That's the only thing I knew I was going to do different. I wanted a D.J. and I love music. And so I had a D.J. and when I finish my monologue I come out and do basically a little bit of stand-up I talk about what's going on in my life. When I go to sit down there's music playing and I like to dance so I dance. It started as joke. Then I started dancing more and then suddenly the audience started standing up and dancing with me. Now it's a major part of the show where I dance in the beginning and it's a huge thing.,INTERVIEWER, Do you do it even if the first guest is on a very serious topic?,INTERVIEWEE, We don't have serious topics.,INTERVIEWER, No serious topics at all?,INTERVIEWEE, No.,INTERVIEWER, What's as serious as you get?,INTERVIEWEE, I don't know. We don't really -- I don't talk about anything...,INTERVIEWER, No issue-oriented?,INTERVIEWEE, No. Nothing issue -- that's just not me. I wouldn't even know where to go with that stuff.,INTERVIEWER, So it's the personality of the guest? The guest drives it rather than the subject driving it?,INTERVIEWEE, It's whoever's on. We -- you know Pamela Anderson was on today which will air tomorrow and she has a new clothing line and she brought out like a teddy a skimpy kind of brassiered teddy thing and I put it on over my clothes. And whatever's happening I just go with it or I try do something different than what they would do on another show.,INTERVIEWER, You also have a male audience right? A significant male audience. How do you explain that? First of all where are they in the daytime?,INTERVIEWEE, I don't know. I've heard that stockbrokers are watching the show. I mean a lot of people take an hour to watch the show. They'll stop working and watch or they Tivo it or VCR you know tape it and then watch it at night. It's everyone. It's kids and it's you know it's women obviously that's a big daytime audience but it's a lot of you know it's everybody.,INTERVIEWER, The time you're usually on is what late morning or early afternoon?,INTERVIEWEE, New York we're on at 10 a.m. L.A. 3:00 and then different markets different times. Usually late morning or early afternoon.,INTERVIEWER, Unlike a sitcom which is on a network when you're syndicated you're on different affiliates in all cities you have to be involved in the promotion of the show?,INTERVIEWEE, We do promos and you do -- you know I do what I can.,INTERVIEWER, Do you talk to stations?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, Are you very very involved?,INTERVIEWEE, I'm involved as much as I can possibly be. The show takes up a lot of my time. But you know to start out a show it's a lot of press and I've done a lot of press work.,INTERVIEWER, How do you explain Ellen overcoming all of the personal things that made the press with you. You had to overcome a lot. The breakup coming out that you became that person. How did you ride that wave out?,INTERVIEWEE, You know exactly that. I think I rode it out. There was nothing to fight. Because for a while I did -- I tried to fight it I don't understand I don't understand what I did wrong. I don't understand why -- you know and whether it was true or not I felt like people hated me. That's what it felt like.,INTERVIEWER, Because you broke up or because you came out or all of the above? ,INTERVIEWEE, I felt like -- well mainly I felt like people hated me because I wasn't getting work. That's where that feeling came from. The phone stopped ringing and nobody was interested in anything to do with me. And then the break-up was public which was painful because it's you know it's painful anyway and it was public and it was huge and it was you know. And I just tried to refocus everybody back on who I was before all of this. And that I thought if they just get to know me if they just see me and see I'm not dangerous I'm not scary I'm not doing anything wrong I'm not trying to be an activist. If I was trying to be an activist I would have done that with my time off rather than try to get my career back on track.,INTERVIEWER, Did you hire a PR agency to assist in sort of recreating an image?,INTERVIEWEE, No.,INTERVIEWER, So this was -- you rode the wave alone?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes. I didn't have representation for a long long time. I went to my manager who I have now and said help me. It's been three years and I'm not working. And I need to work and I know that I can do this. I just need to be give a chance. And there isn't someone else like me out there. And that's what makes it hard because they don't know what to compare me to but give me a chance and I can work.,INTERVIEWER, How did you get "Finding Nemo?",INTERVIEWEE, Andrew Stanton who wrote and directed the film when "Ellen" was on when my sitcom was on his wife was watching the show while he was writing it and he could hear my voice in the background and the rambling and the digression and that's what Dory was this rambling. And he wrote it with me in mind. So he wrote that movie for me and came to me and said you have to say yes because I wrote this for you. He didn't care about what was going on he didn't care that I wasn't working he didn't care about anything and offered me the role.,INTERVIEWER, Great for your career though?,INTERVIEWEE, Huge. Huge for my career.,INTERVIEWER, Back with Ellen DeGeneres. Her book "The Funny Thing Is..." is going to be out in trade paperback when?,INTERVIEWEE, Any day now.,INTERVIEWER, How big a thing was that? Memory fades but that was big wasn't it?,INTERVIEWEE, No. That will never fade. That was about as big a thing as you can have happen in your life. It was big just privately. It was big for me to let go of that shame and to just finally tell people instead of holding onto the shame that I felt. But it was really big.,INTERVIEWER, The biggest audience you'll ever have on a television night right?,INTERVIEWEE, I don't know I'll try to aim for bigger. ,INTERVIEWER, For nighttime?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes 46 million viewers in one night. Yes and then I heard like in New York they had closed down restaurants and people were -- you know you could hear cheering in the streets and...,INTERVIEWER, Why do you think we're fascinated with that subject of a person's sexuality?,INTERVIEWEE, I don't know?,INTERVIEWER, Why should it matter one could ask the question at all?,INTERVIEWEE, I would love to ask that question. Why does it matter? It doesn't matter. And that's why I think that I just wanted the show -- because my character was coming out I wanted the show to be funny I wanted it to be poignant I wanted it to be what people could relate to and make it funny because it's not usually funny. It's really hard and it's really sad and you're usually kicked out of your family or society or church. You know there are a lot of people that can't do it. So I don't know why it matters. But for some reason it matters tremendously.,INTERVIEWER, That was the Emmys that were postponed because of 9/11. That put you in a tougher spot. Was that one of the tough spots to be in?,INTERVIEWEE, Oh it was horrible because that was the third one that we wrote. We were doing one before 9/11.,INTERVIEWER, For 9/18 I guess wasn't it?,INTERVIEWEE, No. It was before that. It was like -- or maybe right after that. Then 9/11 happened then we were canceled. Then we wrote another one which I didn't want to do I begged to get out of that. And they said you have to do this. And they said just don't make it funny. It's like well you know that's not my job. So then I wrote a serious one and then we started the war. And then so we had to cancel -- literally I was -- rehearsed all day long and was just about to go into hair and makeup and they said the war just started. So then we canceled that one. And then we had another one. And there were bomb-sniffing dogs going through my dressing room.,INTERVIEWER, Most security I ever saw in my life going into that.,INTERVIEWEE, Sharpshooters everywhere. I knew everything that was going on. Nobody else did. But I was aware of all the things that were going on who was in the audience. It was so frightening to relax and to follow Walter Cronkite and everything that I had to do it's like it was really tough.,INTERVIEWER, Now what's with "Oh God" You're going to be George Burns?,INTERVIEWEE, All right. Let's put it that way.,INTERVIEWER, Give me the history of this.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes. We were looking for a movie for me to do. And I really had no interest in doing one unless it was exactly the right thing. My manager said what if you remake "Oh God" and you play God you play the George Burns part? And I thought that was hilarious.,INTERVIEWER, We say remake it a similar script you help a grocery store clerk?,INTERVIEWEE, No. Not at all. No. So it's based on -- it's loosely based on. It's going to be more current about -- in commenting more about -- my last special "Here & Now" comments on technology and what has happened. And my take on technology is it has gotten out of hand and we've lost what's important which is silence and communication and no one talks anymore. Everybody is on cell phones. And I think if I'm going to play God it's going to be sort of that take on what is going on what has happened with...,INTERVIEWER, What went wrong?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes. Sort of. There's a lot that has gone wrong. But it has to be funny.,INTERVIEWER, Will God be gay?,INTERVIEWEE, No. No.,INTERVIEWER, I mean you could see you doing that too in the modern world no?,INTERVIEWEE, Not really. Not really. I mean I think that it's not going to be -- first of all I think that would make it very political. It's political enough that God is a woman or that anyone is playing. I mean when George Burns did it they got upset -- you know "they" I don't know who "they" are...,INTERVIEWER, This Jewish guy that was God.,INTERVIEWEE, He was Jewish very upset because someone Jewish was playing God. It's a movie you know? So it's like -- and I'm a woman which is already going to be something that people are going to be up in arms about. So it's just -- it's not really about -- it's not going to be about anything about sexual orientation it's going to be about what's funny with people.,INTERVIEWER, Are you shooting it now?,INTERVIEWEE, No. I'm doing my talk show every day. We start in June if we can get the writer on board we're compiling a list of screenwriters.,INTERVIEWER, Who else is in it anyone cast?,INTERVIEWEE, We haven't -- until we write it and until figure out what it is we can't cast it. So I have some ideas.,INTERVIEWER, Any director?,INTERVIEWEE, No. We're hoping -- we're trying to...,INTERVIEWER, So far it's just you right is that what you're saying?,INTERVIEWEE, All right. It's not going to happen Larry.,INTERVIEWER, I'm pressing in there now because...,INTERVIEWEE, So far it's just -- we just closed the deal. So they didn't want to make a deal with anybody else until we decided for sure it's going to happen.,INTERVIEWER, The man is not wound up too tight?,INTERVIEWEE, Oh man I was scared to death. I thought he cracked his head open.,INTERVIEWER, He is unique.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes. Jim Carrey.,INTERVIEWER, To say the least. Our guest is Ellen Degeneres. We're going to include -- you were just telling me you have a contract for five years and you wouldn't mind if it went forever?,INTERVIEWEE, I would love for it to go -- easily I could see doing this for another 10 or 15 years?,INTERVIEWER, Why?,INTERVIEWEE, I love it. I feel like I'm the most fortunate person. I mean everything I've done has led me to this job you know being a comedian and just everything I've done.,INTERVIEWER, It's nice to have a job to feel like -- I have that where you feel you have the best gig. I mean what could be a better gig than this?,INTERVIEWEE, Nothing could be better than this for me. I mean a sitcom was always like yes it was great but you're playing the same character over and over. This I get to be myself. I don't have to be funny all the time. I can just have a conversation. If I'm funny that's great too. It's -- it's fun.,INTERVIEWER, And the money's pretty good?,INTERVIEWEE, the money's find.,INTERVIEWER, From Marie Ontario Hello. Yes hello.,INTERVIEWEE, Good evening to you.,INTERVIEWER, I would like to ask you what's your most -- you funniest or your most memorable moment on your talk show so far? The one we just showed wasn't bad.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes there have been a few -- there was one that no one saw and then we replayed it I fell that was -- it wasn't funny it was embarrassing but it turned out to be funny. It's a good lesson to remember that even though something is painful it will be funny at some point. There are things people say or things that I say that I don't know what I'm saying and I am sorry afterwards. I don't know if...,INTERVIEWER, When you say nobody saw what do you mean nobody saw it?,INTERVIEWEE, I was walking off and we had been doing fake snow it was Christmas and fake snow was dropping and I slipped and fell really hard. Then we got this telestrator which we call a "Looky- Lou" (ph) out of it so we can look back and look at things and market. So I don't know -- I'm sure that she was asking because she had one I should have asked her. Is she gone?,INTERVIEWER, Gone.,INTERVIEWEE, Sorry.,INTERVIEWER, You still do stand-up though right?,INTERVIEWEE, No.,INTERVIEWER, "Here and Now" is stand-up isn't?,INTERVIEWEE, It's my last special. I haven't done -- since that special that's probably my last HBO special that I'll ever do.,INTERVIEWER, Don't you miss that?,INTERVIEWEE, No.,INTERVIEWER, Standing on stage making people laugh?,INTERVIEWEE, I do it everyday.,INTERVIEWER, Yes but not with guests just you.,INTERVIEWEE, No it's me and the audience. I come out and I do about you know three or five minutes...,INTERVIEWER, Yes but you don't an hour.,INTERVIEWEE, It's better. I get to come out and do three to five minutes of stand-up and it's brand new every single day. When you're doing the tour you're doing the same material every night. So you know this is...,INTERVIEWER, You don't miss that at all.,INTERVIEWEE, No.,INTERVIEWER, Arcata California with Ellen -- Ellen -- Ellen DeGeneres. I've got the trial on my mind that's tomorrow night. What do we got tomorrow night the women of court TV. Ellen DeGeneres for Arcata -- for Arcata hello. Hello Ellen. I'm a huge fan of yours. And I was wondering it would make my day if you could do a Dory voice and a Dory quote or something?,INTERVIEWEE, A Dory voice and quote?,INTERVIEWER, Come on let's hear Dory's voice.,INTERVIEWEE, Well it's basically this voice. There's nothing really -- because I asked if they were -- but I'll just keep swimming just keep swimming. That -- I'm Dory what's your name. That's my voice.,INTERVIEWER, Did you think -- you knew they were Pixar and you know that's a big hit. Did you think it would be as huge as it was?,INTERVIEWEE, No. I thought that I would be the one to jinx it. Because everything I had done so far movie-wise was not a huge hit. So I thought this was the one Pixar film and if it doesn't do well then am the common denominator.,INTERVIEWER, What did you think when you saw it?,INTERVIEWEE, It was gorgeous. It's smart and it's funny and it's beautiful.,INTERVIEWER, And it looks great.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes. It's just you know -- and the fact kids watch it all the time.,INTERVIEWER, All the time.,INTERVIEWEE, Do your kids watch it?,INTERVIEWER, How about nightly? Hi Ellen I love your show. I wanted to ask I have a roommate who is just starting out performing at our local comedy club. And I wanted to ask what advice you'd give to him as far as an aspiring comic like learning how to network and getting his name out there? ,INTERVIEWEE, You know the only thing I really recommend if you're starting out in stand-up is to not try to copy anybody else. You can be influenced by people. I was influenced by Steve Martin and Bob Newhart and Woody Allen but I never tried to be someone else. I always tried to be myself. And the reason people are successful is they're unique. He needs to have style of his own and the material needs to be whatever is true to his voice and his sensibility. It can't be -- and he shouldn't sellout. If somebody says to do something if it's not true to him don't do it no matter what. That's great advice don't do what you're not. Don't do what your not. People will read it right away. I think people love honesty. People know that if your trying to be something your not it's not going to last. It might get attention but....,INTERVIEWER, You don't take stand on social issues -- gay marriage.,INTERVIEWEE, No I would love to see equal rights. I would love to see if I'm in a relationship with somebody and you spend years and years. There are a lot of people who have been together for 30 years and I don't care what it's called. I don't really have the desire to get married. So I don't need that word. And don't -- I just want to be able to be protected and the person I love to be protected should something happen to me and you know we still have the same tax breaks.,INTERVIEWER, Do you think the public continuously more and more aware though that it's better than five years ago and five years ago was better than 10 years ago?,INTERVIEWEE, In some ways. I think that there are always going to be people who like you said for some reason it upsets people. For some reason it's like -- it has become where it is more acceptable because you see more television shows that have gay characters on it. But you know until they start seeing that people are people and we shouldn't -- that's the most dangerous thing that we all judge and go if you're not just like me then you're wrong. I mean that's where we're running into trouble seeing other people that aren't exactly like us and we think they're wrong.,INTERVIEWER, You did a strong show on it you were on this program to discuss "What If These Walls Could Talk" with Sharon Stone and the like. That was making a statement weren't you there?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes you know I guess so. It was more about this was a couple trying to have a baby and the struggle of what it's like -- to not be able to create a baby. And what are the options? Do you adopt? Do to a donor? And it was more of -- more of that.,INTERVIEWER, To Thousand Oaks California. Hello. Ellen Larry good afternoon good evening. What I would like to know you laid out the plans of your show and the movie. My question of what next is kind of moot but what's your wildest dream? What is the brass ring for Ellen? What would be on your death bed that you said I did this? What is the brass ring for you? Good question.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes it's a great question. My wildest dream I was going to go some place else but I realized that was my own personal life. My wildest dream has come true. To do everything that I've done and then to lose everything and then to have another chance to come back because not too many people get a second chance. And not too many women 45-years-old get a second chance. So for me to not only be working again but to be accepted and to feel so embraced you know I didn't think I would have this again. So I would say I probably am experienced -- experiencing my wildest dream.,INTERVIEWER, Second chances are rare.,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, Why?,INTERVIEWEE, You know I don't know. I think that that's a wonderful ability -- I think one of the best qualities anyone can have is forgiveness. And that is the ultimate forgiveness to say she's doing something else lets at least -- that's all I wanted was when I had the show just watch it once. Don't judge what I is don't have a preconceived idea of what this talk show is. It's not political it's not -- there's no agenda. It's light positive funny show. This is who I am. And if people just see maybe I'll have a shot at this.,INTERVIEWER, Did you guest on O'Donnell -- Rosie O'Donnell Show?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes I've been on Rosie's show a few times.,INTERVIEWER, What do you think happened there?,INTERVIEWEE, I don't know. You know maybe she didn't -- I don't really know Rosie that well. I mean I've spoken to her but we're not really friends. We don't like -- so I don't really know and I couldn't say what her...,INTERVIEWER, But the show was top of the world right?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes it was it was.,INTERVIEWER, So it has to instill in any performer the fear that that could happen to me too.,INTERVIEWEE, More than anybody I know what can happen to me. I know every single day that something can happen to take this away. And that's why I think it's so important to be honest with your viewers every single day because if you're not honest you know. And that's why when I did come out I thought I was just being honest. And then my honesty was what kind of -- you know I think it was coupled with a lot of things. But so if -- now I'm honest. That's all I can be. And I hope that they take me...,INTERVIEWER, There are a lot of critics who say don't be phony and then they get mad at you when you're honest. So you're in that that's catch-22 the ultimate. Ellen DeGeneres "The Funny Thing Is" a very funny book. This is a funny book.,INTERVIEWEE, Thank you.,INTERVIEWER, It's coming out in trade paperback any minute maybe now.,INTERVIEWEE, It just -- seconds.,INTERVIEWER, That's fun. You're fun. ,INTERVIEWEE, We're trying to make people's dreams come true and Sean Hayes wanted to run the agility course that a dog did.,INTERVIEWER, Kansas City Missouri hello. Hi Ellen.,INTERVIEWEE, Hi.,INTERVIEWER, Love your show.,INTERVIEWEE, Thank you.,INTERVIEWER, I saw you on tour last year for your -- the one you were doing "Here & Now" and you did a great singing episode. Are you -- a little spot there are you ever going sing on your show more like you do your dancing?,INTERVIEWEE, Occasionally I will sing a note or two. I'm not really a singer. You mean when I was doing "Shoop"?,INTERVIEWER, Maybe could you do a little bit now? Where did you see her sing? In Kansas City when she came and did her "Here & Now" tour.,INTERVIEWEE, When I was on tour when I did a...,INTERVIEWER, You sang in "Here & Now"?,INTERVIEWEE, Well I didn't really sing. I wouldn't call it singing. But you know it was rapping to a little Salt N Pepa "Shoop." It's -- you know now you have seen it and you see it on the DVD. You get the DVD "Here & Now" and you'll see me rapping on "Shoop.,INTERVIEWER, Chattanooga Tennessee hello. Hey Ellen. I'm a big fan of your show.,INTERVIEWEE, Thank you.,INTERVIEWER, And I was just wondering -- I mean you're such a positive strong role model for a lot of people what would it take for you to run for president because lord knows we need someone honest? Would you ever go for political office?,INTERVIEWEE, I would never -- it would take -- there would be nothing to get me to run for president. I don't even understand how anyone would want that job at all. Although I would be able to play golf which I don't seem to have time now. So I think...,INTERVIEWER, Are you a golfer?,INTERVIEWEE, No. But it seems like you have to be if you're president.,INTERVIEWER, Rockford Michigan hello. Hi Ellen I'm a huge fan. You're one of my role models. And I'm a very strong believer in Jesus Christ. And I was wondering if you believe in God at all?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes. Of course I believe in God absolutely.,INTERVIEWER, But what do you make of the teachings that deal with your sexual proclivity where it is a sin and you see these ministers say it's damned from hell as if you chose this?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes. I find it interesting. I was raised to believe that God is love. That is what I saw in church every day as -- every Sunday is God is love and God is good. And I don't associate judgment and -- with love. I just don't -- I believe in compassion I believe in love and I believe in people being as good as they can to one another so I don't really pay attention to the people that have those beliefs. And that's their right to have those beliefs and...,INTERVIEWER, Do you get angry at them?,INTERVIEWEE, I used to. I used to get angry. But then I don't think I'm being any better than if they're angry at me and I'm angry at them what does that do? So now I just feel like everybody has a right to have their opinion.,INTERVIEWER, How do you maintain your nicety? Really I'm not kidding. You've been wrapped around a lot. You're into things that people are bewildered about and you remain accessible nice. Do you have to work at that really?,INTERVIEWEE, Not really.,INTERVIEWER, You like people?,INTERVIEWEE, I do like people. Sometimes I don't like people. Sometimes I get really frustrated and sometimes I don't understand how people that aren't nice are liked and admired and I think they don't seem like they're really being honest or really being nice and yet everybody is -- I don't understand that. But I think I am -- you know -- I think I'm a good person you know I really do.,INTERVIEWER, I think you are too. Hagerstown Maryland hello. Hi. This is Chris. Hi Ellen.,INTERVIEWEE, Hi Chris.,INTERVIEWER, Hi. We're big supporters of yours no matter what. We love you. And I was just wondering you were talking about second chances and we heard that you have a new partner and we were wondering how life was going with her?,INTERVIEWEE, Life is very very good. We've been together for four years this month which is -- I can't believe it has been four years. But life is really good and I'm in a nice quiet relationship that seems...,INTERVIEWER, Is she in the business?,INTERVIEWEE, She's a photographer. Yes so she used to be an actress.,INTERVIEWER, Did you meet with her taking pictures of you?,INTERVIEWEE, No no. We met through friends. I had met her years before. I had met her through -- we have mutual friends. But I was always in relationships and she was in relationships. And now we met when we were single and it has been four years.,INTERVIEWER, That's from the DVD out now from the original show right? Which had a different name right?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes. That was "Ellen" but the first season was called "These Friends of Mine" and it's now out on DVD.,INTERVIEWER, As "Ellen.",INTERVIEWEE, As "Ellen" yes.,INTERVIEWER, Chicago hello. Hi Ellen I love your show it's the best talk show since Phil Donahue.,INTERVIEWEE, Thanks.,INTERVIEWER, I was wondering what was the worst job that you've ever had or the job you've hated the most like since you were ten or whatever?,INTERVIEWEE, My first job I actually liked my first job I was driving cars out of a car wash you know once the car comes out you get in and you wipe it. That was exciting to me to drive the nice cars and wipe down the -- with Emerald. The worst job I ever had and I lasted a half a day was I worked in a glove factory in Atlanta Texas. It was horrible.,INTERVIEWER, What was your job?,INTERVIEWEE, I was checking for too many fingers or a hole or something and gloves would just go by. Just being enclosed. Everything I did that was a 9:00 to 5:00 job I hated. Being in an office. I worked in a law firm. I was a court runner. I just hated being in a office.,INTERVIEWER, Although that episode in the glove factory sounds like an "I Love Lucy" show.,INTERVIEWEE, It wasn't funny like "I Love Lucy" but yes.,INTERVIEWER, Dartmouth Nova Scotia hello. Hi Ellen. Who would you most like to interview and why?,INTERVIEWEE, During commercial breaks I'm interviewing Larry here because I'm fascinated...,INTERVIEWER, I'm testing for the show.,INTERVIEWEE, I'm fascinated by his life. People that you know I've said before I'd like to have Bono on. I think Bono would be interesting. He seems like an amazing real person.,INTERVIEWER, Are you after are you hunting down people?,INTERVIEWEE, We have been fortunate enough that people are hunting us down. We have everybody that you can imagine. And the only reason we don't have him is because they're not in town.,INTERVIEWER, Have you had anyone say no absolutely no I will never go on.,INTERVIEWEE, Not that I know of. Maybe they're protecting me from knowing that. But no no one's never said no.,INTERVIEWER, Are you going to do another book?,INTERVIEWEE, No. That was my second book and they both did very well. Maybe later but not for a while.,INTERVIEWER, So one more movie no more stand-up no more books?,INTERVIEWEE, No.,INTERVIEWER, The "Ellen DeGeneres Show" is it?,INTERVIEWEE, I hope it's enough. I hope that it's an entertaining one-hour show that people look forward to. I don't want people to burn out on me. I don't want to do stuff where people start getting tired of seeing me. It's enough. An hour a day of me is plenty for people.,INTERVIEWER, Do you like the fact that your relationship is known have you gotten accustomed to that now we show the picture? Some people want privacy more.,INTERVIEWEE, We do have our privacy. We're a very private couple. We go to events together just like anyone would go with their husband or wife or boyfriend and girlfriend we go out together. We're a very private couple very quiet and we're very happy. I'm fine with that. I feel like I'm in a very safe secure place for the first time ever.,INTERVIEWER, Does she come to your show?,INTERVIEWEE, She comes as often as she can. She's been busy. She had her first solo show -- her art exhibit and she just directed a short film. So she's been really busy.,INTERVIEWER, Great seeing you dear.,INTERVIEWEE, Thank you very much., INTERVIEWER, Nothing but continued success. You deserve it.,INTERVIEWEE, Thank you.,INTERVIEWER, Tomorrow night the women of Court TV. What a splash they have made on the American scene. Aaron Brown is back in "Newsnight." You want to toss it to him?,INTERVIEWEE, Aaron Brown we're tossing to you.,INTERVIEWER, Give it to him.,INTERVIEWEE, There you go.,INTERVIEWER, So you got it Aaron.,INTERVIEWEE, Take it!,INTERVIEWER, Take it come on. You're on.,INTERVIEWEE, Take it!,INTERVIEWER, What were the inspirations along the way for you—musically, lyrically, or philosophically—that got you to this stage?,INTERVIEWEE, Oh, man. First off would have to be how I was raised. The environment. My father being a complete realist, just in the streets. And my mother being a dreamer. It starts there first, before I even heard any type of melody or lyric. That's just DNA. It's always the yin and the yang, the good versus the evil. And that pushed me toward the music that I love to listen to. You know, Tupac, Biggie, Jay. Your usual suspects. These were the people that was played in my household.,INTERVIEWER, Was the music playing in your house your choice of music, or was it the music your parents were listening to?,INTERVIEWEE, Definitely my parents. My parents were fairly young in the city of Compton. So the things that they played—you know, that was the hip crowd. So I was being exposed to all these ideas, from Big Daddy Kane to Eazy-E to the Bay Area—Too Short, E-40—you know, back to Marvin Gaye and the Isley Brothers. This field of music just broadened my ideas to come. We never would've thought in a million years that I'd be doing it.,INTERVIEWER, When did jazz find its way into your world?,INTERVIEWEE,It's a trip, because I was in the studio one day, and my guy Terrace Martin noticed something about the type of sounds that I was picking. He was like, Man, a lot of the chords that you pick are jazz-influenced. You don't understand: You a jazz musician by default. And that just opened me up. And he just started breaking down everything, the science, going back to Miles, Herbie Hancock.,INTERVIEWER, So when was that moment?,INTERVIEWEE,About three months into my second LP, To Pimp a Butterfly.,INTERVIEWER, After hearing the first album, when the second album came, it was completely unexpected. Like, nobody was expecting you to make that.,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah, definitely. I knew from the jump that it was gonna be a challenge for my listeners' ear. But if I'm challenging myself in the studio, I want to challenge you as well. I just went full-fledged with it, man. We built everything from scratch.,INTERVIEWER, This is kind of a funny thing, because I'm going to ask you to project into the future here. But do you feel like Butterfly—what do you refer to it as?,INTERVIEWEE,Butterfly, To Pimp a Butterfly. It's a few things.,INTERVIEWER, Okay, I thought maybe To Pimp. But let's say the second album. Do you feel like that's more indicative of where things will be in the future? Or is it more like, based on the difference between the first album and the second album, we should continue to expect it to change?,INTERVIEWEE, That's a great question.,INTERVIEWER, It may not even be possible to answer, but tell me your best thoughts.,INTERVIEWEE, My best thoughts… The best answer I can give you, um… That was me then.,INTERVIEWER, Yeah.,INTERVIEWEE, Not to say that it wouldn't be continuous. It'll always have some type of DNA in my music. But me, as a person, I grow. I'm like a chameleon. You know? That is a gift and a curse for me. But more so a gift, because it never puts me in a box. And my ability to express and still make the connection wherever I go, that is my high point. That's something I pride myself off of.,INTERVIEWER, I think that what's infectious about your music—the reason other people connect—is they feel your connection to it. Probably a lot of your fans might not have been into jazz. But they feel your connection to it, and it inspires them to open themselves to hear new music that they might not have heard.,INTERVIEWEE, We've been told to call the consumers dumb, but they're not. They know when it's real. And that's something that I always understood—just from being a fan myself.,INTERVIEWER, When making music, do you ever consider the audience at all, or is it more just self-expression?,INTERVIEWEE, I used to consider the listener. But now I'm in a space where if I'm not inspired, I can't really do the music. I can't feel it. I put in enough hours to be able to pen a hundred-bar verse on the spot at any given moment. But for me to actually feel an idea, it has to come from me. And a lot of times, I have to block out different needs and wants just for my own selfish reasons. But at the end of the day, it comes out where, whether you like it or not, you know it comes from a real place. It's gonna feel unapologetic, uncompromising, and it's gonna feel me.,INTERVIEWER, When you say unapologetic, has there ever been anything that comes up that you feel like, I don't want to say that on a record?,INTERVIEWEE, That's a great question. I always said to myself, if I said it on a record, I never retract my statements. Because it's my self-expression, and you can have your opinions on it, you can feel a certain type of way, but it's how I feel. And I can't contradict that at all.,INTERVIEWER, Beautiful. And do you ever look back on anything and feel like you'd like to change any of the things that you've written?,INTERVIEWEE, It would be me saying, I want to go deeper. I shoulda went deeper.,INTERVIEWER, Content-wise, do you feel like you could talk about anything?,INTERVIEWEE, I could talk about anything. That is the challenge for me. Being able to talk about anything and make it connect to a listener. Where a listener can either feel like you or feel like they understand you. Talking to a little kid and making that feel like something. Or saying the most brutal, harsh things on a record, where, you know, society may not want to hear it. That's what music is about for me.,INTERVIEWER, Let's talk about “Alright” for a second. It has become our generation's protest song.,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah, yeah.,INTERVIEWER, When you wrote it, did you have that in mind? Did you think of it as a protest song?,INTERVIEWEE, No. You know what? I was sitting on that record for about six months. The beat's Pharrell. And between my guy Sam Taylor and Pharrell, they would always be like, Did you do it? When you gonna do it? I knew it was a great record—I just was trying to find the space to approach it. I mean, the beat sounds fun, but there's something else inside of them chords that Pharrell put down that feels like—it can be more of a statement rather than a tune. So with Pharrell and Sam asking me—Am I gonna rock on it? When I'm gonna rock on it?—it put the pressure on me to challenge myself. To actually think and focus on something that could be a staple in hip-hop. And eventually, I came across it. Eventually, I found the right words. You know, it was a lot going on, and still, to this day, it's a lot going on. And I wanted to approach it as more uplifting—but aggressive. Not playing the victim, but still having that We strong, you know?,INTERVIEWER, So you had the beat for six months, but you didn't have any words?,INTERVIEWEE, I didn't have any words. P knew that that record was special. Sam knew that the record was special. They probably knew it before I even had a clue. So I'm glad that they put that pressure on me to challenge myself. 'Cause sometimes, as a writer, you can have that writer's block. And when you like a sound or an instrumental, you want to approach it the right way. So you sit on it.,INTERVIEWER, Yeah, the timing is not really in our control. You can't say, I got this track I like, so I'm gonna write to it now. It comes when it's supposed to come. You just have to be open to it and ready for it when it comes.,INTERVIEWEE,Exactly. I remember hitting P on a text like, Man, I got the lyrics. And typing the lyrics to him. He's like, That's it.,INTERVIEWER, And did you have a scat over it before?,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah, I had a scat.,INTERVIEWER, Did it have that phrasing?,INTERVIEWEE, Different cadences. You know?,INTERVIEWER, Hook or not yet?,INTERVIEWEE, P had the hook.,INTERVIEWER, Oh, cool. It's a good hook.,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah, P had the alright. That's him on the hook. And just saying the alright phrase—what does We are gonna be alright represent? I'm glad that sparked the idea, 'cause that song coulda went a thousand other ways.,INTERVIEWER, Do you consider yourself first and foremost a rapper?,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah, definitely.,INTERVIEWER, Could you imagine making an album in the future where you're not rapping?,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah, I think I got the confidence for it. If I can master the idea and make the time to approach it the right way, I think I can push it out.,INTERVIEWER, It's really interesting now, with what's going on in hip-hop. It's almost like you're a throwback to when lyrics mattered. So much of hip-hop today is about vibe and swag and personality, and less about words. And it sometimes sounds like even the MC doesn't know what he's saying on a lot of today's records. So it's interesting to hear the sort of clarity and depth that you go into lyrically.,INTERVIEWEE, The clarity, I got my clarity just studying Eminem when I was a kid. How I got in the studio was all just curiosity. I had a love for the music, but it was curiosity. The day I heard The Marshall Mathers LP, I was just like, How does that work? What is he doing? How is he putting his words together like that? What's the track under that? An ad-lib? What is that? And then, Why don't you go in the studio and see? So I do that. Then it became, How's his words cutting through the beat like that? What is he doing that I'm not doing, now that I'm into it? His time is impeccable. When he wants to fall off the beat, it's impeccable. These are things that, through experience and time, I had to learn.,INTERVIEWER, It's lucky that you got to learn it so young. It gave you time to grow so much.,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah, definitely—13, 14 years old.,INTERVIEWER, Crazy. In one of your lyrics, you mention meditation. Do you have a meditation practice?,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah, man. I have to have at least 30 minutes to myself. If it's not on the daily, every other day, to just sit back, close my eyes, and absorb what's going on. You know, the space that I'm in. When you in music—and everybody knows this—the years are always cut in half, because you always have something to do. We in the studio for four months, that go by. Now you gotta go on the road for five months, that go by. Next thing you know, five years going by and you 29 years old. You know? So I have to find a way to understand the space that I'm in and how I'm feeling at the moment. 'Cause if I don't, it's gonna zoom. I know. I feel it. And I'm sure you know what I'm talking about. It just goes and then you miss out on your moment because you're so in the moment you didn't know the moment was going on, if that makes sense.,INTERVIEWER, Absolutely. You can get lost. I know some artists get lost in touring. They become less relatable. All they know is being onstage and accolades and hotels. Their reality is so different from everybody else's reality that it's not so interesting.,INTERVIEWEE, I like to call it a cartoon world. And you know, you can really get lost in it so fast. It's scary out there.,INTERVIEWER, How'd you get the idea to do the 30 minutes every day or every other day?,INTERVIEWEE, Well, just knowing my schedule and how much I think about music. Someone brought it to my attention—it's all I think about. And it's nothing wrong with that. It becomes me, it becomes my life. I breathe it. I can't think about nothing else. And once I started realizing that, I know that I have to give it some time and space every now and then. And that 30 minutes helps. That 30 minutes helps me to totally zone out and not think about my next lyric. You know? It gives me a re-start, a jump start, a refresh. It lets me know why I'm here, doing what I'm doing.,INTERVIEWER, Do you have anyone around you who tells you if something's not good?,INTERVIEWEE, For sure. Man, I'd be head over heels right now if I didn't have a certain type of grounding. Family, a team that has my best interests—not only in music but as a person. Everyone that's around me has been with me since I was 15 years old. I know we'll all grow as people, and I'll outgrow some people and different natures, but I hope that these same people will continue to grow with me. 'Cause I can't stop. You know? I can't stop.,INTERVIEWER, Do you have any idea of the direction that's coming next, as far as writing goes, or is it too soon?,INTERVIEWEE, It's soon. I have ideas, though. I have ideas and I have a certain approach. But I wanna see what it manifests. I wanna put all the paint on the wall and see where that goes. Maybe you can help me with that.,INTERVIEWER, I'm down. Cool. For Butterfly, did you record more songs than the ones on the album?,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah, definitely. I have so many floating around—24 bars, 16 bars, hooks and choruses and bridges and ideas. References that I had in mind for people to sing.,INTERVIEWER, Beautiful.... Anything else you want to talk about?,INTERVIEWEE, Let's check out this space, man! I'm in a creative zone!,INTERVIEWER, Should we go inside and record?,INTERVIEWEE, Exactly.,
