 Tonight Johnny Depp The man who rarely grants interviews sits down with me and opens up about his fame,

 This is the card I drew so Ill deal with it thats fine Doesnt mean every single moment you have to be sort of OK with it,

 His family,

 I dont want my kids to experience me as a novelty I want my kids to know me as dad,

 And his famous friends Brando had that big an effect on you?,

 He was a wonderful man You know? Hed give you anything,

  Plus well go on a tour of his private office full of personal memorabilia and his paintings You dont do many things like this Do you not like to be interviewed or ,

 No Im just not very good at it you know Never have been very good at it,

 Why not?,

 I dont know Theres a you know theres a strange thing you know Im OK when Im a character If Im playing a character I can do you know virtually anything in front of a camera But if Im just me I feel you know exposed and sort of you know it feels awkward,

 We wont expose you,

 OK Good,

 Do you like being other people?,

 Yes I do I do because Im fascinated with people I mean Im fascinated I like to watch people And thats the one sort of thing you know as an actor in terms of job necessity is the ability to be able to watch people to observe to be the observer As a journalist you know to observe And its one of my favorite things to sort of pick apart you know various traits,

 Marlon Brando told me that one of the problems is when you get very well known is theyre observing you,

  That becomes the problem,

  You cant youre not observing them really,

  Yes Exactly No that becomes the problem You become the focus of others So therefore your ability to observe is tainted You know its a little bit yes It changes quite radically,

  How did you go from guitar to acting?,

  Accident,

  How did it happen?,

  Id moved to Los Angeles in 1983 and was living here playing you know playing music And we did a couple of good gigs You know the band and stuff And we went on the road for a little bit And that was all fine But I mean in terms of making a living it was pretty straight you know pretty close to the bone there So I was filling out job applications for just various like video stores or anywhere you know And I happened to be with an old buddy of mine Nicolas Cage And who was who was then coming up the ranks And he said that you know why dont you just I think you should meet my agent You should investigate acting,

  You hadnt thought of it?,

  No not really no No And so I met his agent She sent me to read for a part And got a call back and then they hired me for the gig You know that was the first Nightmare on Elm Street That was 1984? Three or four,

  Did you like it right away?

  No,

  It was a job?,

  It was just a gig You know I just thought well this will get me through you know until you know the music picks up or whatever You know So I just you know the first two or three four films to me were just you know a lark You know just ,

  Would you rather have been a musician?,

  In retrospect no you know In retrospect no Because its I suppose had that become my bread and butter as they say you know the main gig I would have probably fallen out of love with it on some level And I still to this day you know have the the same love you know first love feeling for music as I did when I was 12,

  Do you play?,

  All the time yes Constantly Still yes,

  How did you react to getting famous?,

  Im still reacting you know Im still sort of dealing with it I dont think its anything you ever get used to you know I could never for many years I could never sort of put my name in the same sort of category as the word famous or anything like that And I just found it very uncomfortable So its weird Its something like if you I find if you get used to it then something must be wrong you know If you get used to that constant kind of thing its somethings got to be wrong Theres got to be still a part of you that somewhere in there that pines for anonymity,

  Allen Alda told me one that he doesnt like giving autographs because he feels it demeans the person asking for the autograph It put them on a lower level And Brando didnt like much being photographed Is it true you dont like being photographed?,

  I suppose like for example when youre doing something organized like a photo shoot essentially amid the faux pas of you know there was a piece in Vanity Fair where I should have used the word violated However you know in my in my lack of vocabulary in the moment I used another word which Ive you know apologized for radically But the thing the thing with doing a photo shoot thats sort of an organized thing You feel dumb OK But you just get through it But what I find still to this day kind of like an attack on the senses is really just being bombarded by paparazzis You know Ill take photographs with kids People you know who want to take photographs with me People who like the movies People who supported me Ill do that all day all night thats fine But the bombardment you know of the paparazzi is just its like a its just ,

  What do they get out of it? I mean they take your picture

  Yes,

  And then they take it a minute later Its not any different than a minute before,

  And its not any different than the year before or the year before that,

  So what is the what do you think it is?,

  I truly dont understand I think it must be just this kind of I dont know It just feels like this kind of gluttonous horrific sport Its like sport Its like hunting or something,

  Do you therefore go out of your way to try to avoid them?

  Yes I try to avoid you know any and all you know press or especially that nature You know just to yes I just ,

  So do you ,

  I dont want my kids to experience me as a novelty I want my kids to know me as dad you know And already you know if they have access to the Internet or whatever I mean they understand what the deal is But I dont want them to have to live through and experience that kind of attack you know,

  So what do you do when you go out to eat?,

  I dont go out very much you know I stay at home a lot Or when you go out to eat you know youve got to it becomes a strategic sort of plan,

  Getting in through the side door,

  OK were going in the back Were going to walk through the slippery kitchen and were going to go into the private room or you know that kind of thing,

  Its a tough way to live,

  Its you know I suppose its what I its the card I drew So Ill deal with it Thats fine But you know it doesnt mean that every single moment you have to be sort of OK with it I certainly am not one of those guys and would you know cant stand the idea of you know one of those guys who whines about you know how horrible success is I do realize and understand very well on a profound level how lucky I am and what a privileged position it is and what its done ultimately for me my family and my kids But at the same time you know there are moments in a mans life when you just kind of want to feel somewhat normal you know,

  Hes one of the biggest stars in the world But it wasnt always that way,

  I had been essentially known within the confines of Hollywood as the you know as box office poison You know basically Id built a career on 20 years of failures,

  Plus later Johnny shows me the inside of his private office Its an up close and personal look at a Johnny Depp you will not want to miss When this Larry King SPECIAL Johnny Depp returns Paul Newman told me that any successful person in any field who in discussing their career doesnt use the word luck is a liar,

  Yes Hes absolutely right yes,

  So you consider yourself lucky?,

  Very lucky yes,

  But you have to have talent to meet the luck right?,

  Somebody hands you the ball and you run you know And then if you get hit you get hit or maybe you make it through you never know But I mean I just know that somebody handed me the ball at a certain point And I was hungry enough to keep running And Im still running So ,

  Now what do you think makes you good at what you do? You have to think youre good,

  Im OK,

  You dont watch yourself right?,

  I dont No I dont I dont like to watch myself I think you know I maintain a hunger but not an ambition You know I Im very happy to explore all possibilities of a character and really you know dive into the role You know to the point where Disney wanted to wanted to fire me,

  They wanted to fire you from Pirates?,

  Yes,

  Because?,

  They couldnt understand what I was doing You know? They didnt understand the character They were actually contemplating subtitling the film you knowYou will always remember this as the day that you almost caught Captain Jack,

  Ever turned down something you regretted?,

  No,

  No?,

  Dont regret any of it no No Everything that I turned down was it was weirdly it was more important what I turned down than what I accepted in terms of films

  For your own happiness?,

  Mm-hmm,

  So even if it became a hit?,

  Yes Pirates was a complete accident you know? I mean prior ,

  What do you mean?,

  Well prior to Pirates of the Caribbean you know the first one in 2003 that was I mean I had been essentially known within the confines of Hollywood as the you know as box office poison you know what Im saying? You know basically had built a career on 20 years of failures,

  Did it surprise you its success?,

  Hugely I had no idea,

  Are you going to do more?,

  You know it depends,

  Does it ever become maybe too much?,

  Not yet you know Not yet for me I mean maybe maybe to the masses I dont know Maybe I dont know I still feel like in terms of character Captain Jack is one that Id like to explore,

  Hes still evolving?,

  Yes Because hes because hes fun you know Its his fun Its a license to be totally and utterly irreverent and get away with it,

  Hes going to age then?,

  I suppose hell have to,

  Discuss some others Some incredible roles youve played Edward Scissorhands,

  Probably the most important film that Ive ever done just in terms of the the transition for me you know from basically at the time you know being known as having come up the ranks as a TV actor essentially in the minds of Hollywood Scissorhands was the one that sort of put me on the road that I wanted to be on So for me that ones yes thats probably the most important of all,

  Mad Hatter,

  A gas You know I mean just a gas Again one of those things where you get a call from Tim and he says what do you think about this? And you just you just start to travel you know,

  You just did Dark Shadows right?,

  Just finished,

  Finished That was a soap opera about a vampire,

  Yes,

  What attracted you to that?,

  Well I had watched it as a kid you know Religiously I remember sprinting home from school to see it Didnt want to miss like a minute of it Ironically you know Tim had gone through the same experience You know running home from school And then back when we were doing Sweeney we were doing Sweeney Todd a couple of years ago it one day were just sitting there talking and I said you know we should do a vampire movie sometime Lets do a vampire movie It was before all the Twilights and all that you know stuff And yes thats a good idea I went oh Dark Shadows man And so we got on the Dark Shadows tangent And then one thing led to another,

  So was Willy Wonka fun?,

  Absolutely fun Yes Really fun,

  Do you have to enjoy it to do it? 

  I think you have to I mean I think its got to be fun The process itself must be fun You have to enjoy what youre doing And as we all know as you know as well as I do its a collaborative process you know Its not just lets put the actor in front of the camera There are many people behind the scenes that make it all go, So I would I would find it really a drag if they stick me out in front of the camera and the guys behind the camera werent having a good time too All I do is try to make them laugh Still ahead Johnny talks about his famous co-stars and friends Al Pacino He says Im nuts but hes really like hes certifiably nuts,

  Marlon Brando,

  We got along like a house on fire You know Instantly Theres a dangerous element You never know what to expect from him,

  And Hunter Thompson,

  I realized that this was the voice of truth He was without question I mean I think the most important nonfiction writer of the 20th century,

  Plus get a tour of his private office Wait until you see whats in there But first after supporting them for years Johnny opens up on the release of the West Memphis Three Did you have anybody say to you you know Johnny you go out on a limb on a thing like this?,

  Oh yes,

  Find out why when this LARRY KING SPECIAL: Johnny Depp continues What do you make of finally the release of the Memphis Three? You got involved in that battle We did a whole show on it,

  Yes,

  We had them on And they still not theyre guilty Theyre out But its crazy,

  Its a very strange thing the state of Arkansas presented to them Essentially you know to say OK All you have to do is say that we have the evidence to convict you again and but well do time served and youre out Admitting guilt maintaining your innocence So its a very you know its a really floppy piece of ground to stand on,

  Why did you get involved?,

  Because I I knew immediately you know when I when I first started to get you know kind of familiarize myself with the case I knew instantly that they were innocent I knew instantly that they were wrongfully accused And the more research I did and the more people I spoke to it was absolutely apparent,

  Did you have anybody say to you you know Johnny you go out on a limb on a thing like this,

  Oh yes yes A lot of people,

  Like what if they did it? Youre going to look bad,

  There was that kind of thing Yes But I just knew I just knew you know I it was just it was ugly and and a raw deal from the get-go Back in 93 And youre thinking of these three kids you know one Damien Echols on death row for 18 years Ten years in isolation You know for a crime that he did not commit,

  You think Obama should pardon them?,

  I mean it would be wonderful I dont I think hes probably got a few other things on his mind at the moment But yes yes What Im hoping is that the investigation will continue outside the courthouse right now and we will be able to prove the real killers,

  Back to some roles One I want to play a little clip for you here Because you did one of my favorites one of my all-time favorite movies with one of my dear friends Al Pacino And that was of course Donny Braskow So lets hear lets watch Al talking about you You the same way toward him?,

  Yes Although when youre working with Pacino you know hes great I mean in that moment you know of course you lock in as he said You lock in and youre in the scene and stuff like that But you know as soon as cut comes you go Jesus Christ man Wow Hes monumental,

  He said youre nuts,

  He might be right But hes I mean hes really I mean he says Im nuts but hes really hes like certifiably nuts And one of the funniest human beings Ive ever known in my life,

  From Pacino to Brando Now theres a puzzling aspect of your life that puzzles me You directed and appeared with Brando in a movie,

  Yes,

  That we have never seen,

  Yes The Brave yes,

  Why have we never seen it?,

  I was sort of rushed to take it to the Cannes Film Festival Took it there And then ,

  And it was praised there was it not?,

  It was kind of praised The first night was really wonderful you know I mean you had Bertolucci there and Antonioni and Kustavitza (ph) and all these filmmakers that I really admired and have admired for years you know saying bravo bravo And then you know and then the next day the American press just absolutely lambasted you know me and the film saying its the you know we havent seen a weirder group of people since Bunel and you know and all these kind of strange things And I just ,

  Shelved it?,

  Yes I didnt shelve it You know I owned the North American rights And I just thought you know what? I mean whats the point? You know?,

  Might you release it?,

  Yes Maybe I tell you why For one reason only Its certainly not a perfect film What I will say about that film and what I will say about Marlon in particular its one of the best performances hes given since Last Tango Its one of the performances where he dug down deep and gave of himself so monumentally,

  Was he a little ticked that you didnt release it?,

  No He didnt care No he was fine,

  Thats Marlon,

  Yes He was fine with it,

  Now you did do a movie with him Did you enjoy doing that?,

  Don Juan?,

  Don Juan,

  Yes Very much That was the first Thats when we met and we got along like a house on fire you know instantly And thats where we got very we got close doing Don Juan,

  What did he do that others in the what did he do that the rest of you didnt do?,

  Well Marlon early on I mean Marlon reinvented Marlon reinvented acting He revolutionized acting He made it it was not about behavior in a sense as it was just about being in a moment And he was a dangerous element I mean he was a dangerous element He remained a dangerous element,

  Risk taker,

  Oh yes All the way through man Until you know his last his last breath You know he was he was a dangerous element You never knew what to expect from him,

  Coming up Johnny explains how he made Hunter S Thompsons final wish come true Shooting his ashes out of a cannon,

  He came down over all of us You know we were covered in Hunters ashes It was something that I knew that had to be done and we got it done yes,

  And get an inside look at his office Its all next on this Larry King SPECIAL: Johnny Depp Johnny Depps personal office As interesting and unique as the man himself Inside the walls are lined with personal mementos and photos from his life and work Here a cabinet of curiosities from his movie Sweeney Todd Willy Wonkas throne from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory And his walking stick and that golden ticket One of his guitars Awards and accolades Perhaps one of the most interesting things to see Johnnys self-made portrait of his friend and mine the legendary Marlon Brando,

  I said hey I made this painting of you You know? And hes you paint?,

  Another amazing man in Johnnys life Hunter S Thompson Here he shows us a letter and a check Something he received after Thompson lost a bet over the 1998 World Cup Johnny became friends with Thompson before he filmed Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas It was a friendship that endured for years and one that led to his latest movie The Rum Diary All right lets talk about Hunter Thompson And your friendship with him You led to this movie Rum Diary based on him You found this novel right? He never written we never knew he wrote a novel, 

  No no I happened upon it Hunter and I it was when I was researching Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and I was living in his basement you know and I happened upon this box As we were looking through the manuscript of Fear and Loathing and I see this you know folder,

  Rum Diary across it in his hand I thought wow whats that? You know so we started to read it sitting you know cross-legged on the floor You know reading this amazing thing And hes like my god thats pretty good isnt it? Yes its very good Hunter You know what are you doing? But then he brought up the idea of you know he used to call me Colonel Colonel Depp you know As a colonel we must produce this Well produce this together Itll be our you know so that was the plan Did he know you were going to do it?,

  It took a little while And you know years years happened And then Hunter made his exit you know So he never got to ,

  Did you kind of make a promise that youd make it?,

  Yes Absolutely Yes,

  So this is a commitment?,

  For sure No this was this was fulfilling a commitment to hunter This was absolutely a major promise we are going to produce this thing together And I even so far as to have you know I mean Hunter had his chair on set every day with his name on it He had his script there with his name on it He had there was a bottle of Chivas there every day A highball glass filled with rocks And wed bang in the Chivas We had his Dunhills we had his cigarette filters,

  Its a very unusual film youll agree with that,

  It is yes,

  People will react different ways to it,

  I think so yes,

  So explain to the uninitiated who Hunter Thompson was?,

  He was without question I mean I think the most important nonfiction writer of the of the 20th century,

  When he died you you blew his ashes?,

  Yes,

  How did you come to do that?,

  It was ,

  From a cannon?,

  Yes Built a cannon He it was his last request You know? And it was something that wed talked about here and there But I knew that thats what he wanted And I knew that that had to be done at whatever you know at whatever cost So I met with some you know some kind of architectural wizards and stuff And we built we devised a cannon of 153 feet in the shape of the gonzo fist that would shoot Hunter into the stratosphere,

  Did it make a big sound?,

  Oh boy It was huge  He came down all over all of us You know we were covered in Hunters ashes But the idea also is to take Hunter you know his ashes and then mix that in with gun powder there was something so poetic about that You know its something so kind of symmetrical about Hunter becoming basically large bullets  That he would have loved So I mean it was again it was something that I knew that had to be done and we got it done yes,

  Hes gone from pumping gas to being one of the highest-paid actors in the world,

  I havent changed Im still exactly the guy that used to pump gas you know Im still the guy that was a mechanic for a minute you know Im still exactly I just happen to have a weird weirder job at the moment,

  And Johnny tells us the latest on the Lone Ranger Finally back on? Its going to happen?,

  Yes We got the budget down,

  Thats good to hear,

  Yes,

  Ever want to do theater?,

  Yes There is a part of me There is a part of me that wants to do it you know,

  I mean to have the audience and get the reaction,

  Yes yes There is a part of me that wants to do it But at the same time you know I I suppose the reason to do it is because it just scares the absolute you know ,

  It does scare you?,

  Oh yes,

  You dont have the protection of cut,

  Yes You dont have the protection of cut But also you just walk out there and suddenly just go line You know I mean Im up Whats the line you know? That would be a real drag,

  Is there a play youve liked that youve said to yourself if I do do it I would do that play?,

  It was one one conversation with Marlon where he said he asked me how many movies I did a year And at the time I said I dont know maybe three or something He says too much kid Thats too much We only have so many faces in our pockets you know I said OK I get it He said why dont you play Hamlet? You should play Hamlet I said I dont know you know Hamlets the kind of cliche thing He said no man Do it before youre too old to do it He said I never got the chance I never did it You should do it Go do it And so that still sticks in my head is the possibility of you know before Im too long in the tooth to play Hamlet Its just ,

  Have you ,

  Have I?,

  Yes,

  Yes Every time Me? Yes Sure,

  But what got you down?,

  Well I dont know throughout life and many things but I mean certainly you know losing Marlon you know took me down Losing Hunter took me down Because you know that these these friends these mentors these teachers these father figures you know these someone who you really it was amazing to be accepted by them and to and to be loved by them And suddenly theyre gone you know Yes Those are pretty down times,

  Do you have faith?,

  I have faith in my kids,

  Me too ,

  Yes I have faith in my kids And I have I have faith you know that as long as you keep moving forward just keep walking forward things will be all right I suppose you know Faith in terms of religion I dont religion is not my specialty you know,

  Do you enjoy success? Now you know youre successful Are you do you enjoy it? Do you enjoy the fruits of it?,

  Sure I mean Ive been very like I said very very lucky you know in a sense that you know I mean how ironic is it that you know as I said you get ,

  You were pumping gas,

  I was pumping gas most definitely Printing T-shirts and selling ink pens and you know anything and everything Yes And then the fact that you have a 20-year career of failures and then you do a pirate movie and that buys you an island is pretty the irony of that is pretty good,

  Do you think about the times when things werent so good a lot?,

  Yes yes Oh yes You know there was a guy who I worked with many years ago And we were talking about success and money and all that stuff And he told me this one thing He said you know money doesnt change anybody Money reveals them you know Same thing with success And I believe that you know wholeheartedly I think Ive been revealed I dont think I havent changed Im still exactly the guy that used to pump gas you know Im still the guy that was a mechanic for a minute you know Im still exactly I just happen to have a weird weirder job at the moment you know?,

  It is a weird profession,

  As Marlon said he had Marlon had the best definition of acting that exists you know Its a strange job for a grown man And thats it,

  You do that good,

  Its a strange job for a grown man Right?,

  But he called something else that people in the business got mad at He said it on our show He called it lying for a living,

  Right,

  And most actors say theyre not lying,

  Mmm,

  Did you think that was an unfair expression?,

  I think its totally I think its totally right yes Its lying It is lying Why wouldnt it be? You can make it lying You can make it not lying You know its you can find your own truth But its still a lie You know what I mean? Youre going to go to the craft service table Youre not Henry VIII man Youre not going to have some Fritos or whatever man You know?,

  Have a donut and then go yes,

  Right You know? Hes not going to eat a giant chicken leg and chuck it somewhere and start screaming wench Right? You know? And thats not ,

  Do you like the camera? Burt Reynolds used to say every day hed go up and say to the camera love me today,

  Oh really?,

  Please love me You dont look at your films right?,

  I dont I dont look at my films But what I do is the strange thing is what happens at a certain point its kind of like that thing Marlon said about being observed and having been the observer You get to a place at a certain point where youre more comfortable in front of a camera doing behaving living in front of a camera than you are in normal life That is to say like out at a restaurant or something like that You know the camera becomes sort of just part of the ,

  Same thing in my profession I dont want to discuss myself,

  But you know what I mean?,

  Yes,

  Its just there and thats part of it and thats it,

  Its your comfort zone,

  Yes yes,

  Up next Johnny talks about being a family man,

  Kids are great So fun As you know they just grow up so fast Its just shocking,

  Explains those tattoos Do the kids like it?,

 Yes theyre OK with it you know Yes I mean theyre sort of used to it by now you know When I come home with a new one theyre like oh yes thats good Nice one dad,

  And announces details on his next projects Are you doing a film about Dr Seuss? Youre not into National Enquirer,

  No I mean thank god You know early days you know they tried to sort of slop me into those things but now not so much You know I think they kind of after almost 14 years of Vanessa and two kids I think they kind of ,

  How did you meet Vanessa?,

  I had met her before But very briefly And then it was 98 when I went to do this film with Roman Polanski in Paris I was in the hotel lobby sort of getting my messages And I turned around and was walking back towards my room and then I saw I saw across the room I saw this back this sort of skin of this back and this neck attached to it I just thought my god whats that? And then instantly it turned towards me and walked over and said hello And it was Vanessa And it was that moment when I knew I was absolutely in deep trouble Its over I just knew it It was over And she you know we were going to have a kid You know within three months she was pregnant so it was over,

  What are the kids like?,

  The kids are great So fun,

  Now you live here right? You live in Los Angeles?,

  Yes yes We basically try and spend spend sort of half and half But with the kiddies in school we do a lot here The kids are great you know they just as you know they just grow up so fast Its just shocking,

  I mean you and your sister are very close right?,

  My sister yes Christy is my best friend in the world Shes always kept me alive since I was a little kid,

  So you were family oriented early,

  Very much so,

  Maybe you changed Its hard to change,

  Well unfortunately I have a tendency you know especially these days now when you know the way the work is coming I work a lot And I probably work too much If I could change that Id love to be able ,

  You can change that,

  to spend more time Yes you can But once youve committed to certain things,

  You need that camera,

  Well I need to have the brain occupied for sure You know the brain canopy occupied at all times Otherwise I will go sideways,

  Why tattoos?,

  Like a journal You know,

  You keep a journal of your life on your body?,

  Basically yes It started when I was 17 I got my first tattoo And every single one means something and they all ,

  And the kids like it?,

  Yes Theyre OK with it you know Yes I mean theyre sort of used to it by now You know? When I come home with a new one theyre like oh yes thats good Nice one dad,

  What happened to The Lone Ranger?,

  Its still up and running They ,

  I heard that the budget was too high and theyre not going to do it Youre going to play Tonto right?,

  Yes,

  You have Indian blood right?,

  Yes yes,

  What tribe?,

  I was told you know I was always told it was Cherokee growing up and stuff It may be Cherokee It may be Creek I dont know exactly you know?,

  Is there a script?,

  There is a script Theres a very funny good script,

  Is it a takeoff of The Lone Ranger?,

  Yes,

  Its funny,

  Theres humor Yes Theres a boat load of humor ,

  Does Tonto get to say kimosabe?,

  Yes Yes yes,

  Whos Lone Ranger is made?,

  It going to be Army Harmer Looks like its going to all come together in January,

  So its going to happen,

  Yes We got the budget down yes,

  Thats good to hear,

  Yes,

  So you play him tongue in cheek? How are you going to approach Tonto?,

  I think what I like about Tonto is the idea that this character whos thought of as the sidekick you know it was the thing that bugged me always about The Lone Ranger is why is the Indian the sidekick? Why does he have to go get you that thing? Why does he not,

  Because hes the slave,

  Right And I couldnt stand that always And my approach to Tonto is that hes this sort of theres sort of a crazy like a fox stoicism to Tonto you know that that Tonto probably believes that the Lone Ranger is his slave his sidekick So hes like go get me the thing No no no,

  Hes going to say no?,

  You go get it You go Youre the one dressed in the funny outfit You do it,

  Are they going to do the beginning where all these bunch of rangers are killed and Tonto saves the Lone Rangers life and ,

  Yes Theres certainly elements of that yes for sure You remember it well,

  Oh is there a love interest?,

  Not for Tonto,

  I see he doesnt get one,

  Not for Tonto no,

  Will you do your own Tonto makeup?,

  Will I do my own Tonto makeup?,

  Have you figured out will Tonto one little feather?,

  I think its a little more than that I think Ill tell you what Ill send you a picture of it,

  Please,

  Ive done some tests Ill send you a picture of it Because its its a little its a little different than that What I like about Tonto what I feel good about in terms of Tonto is that I feel like hes you know when I when I came up with Captain Jack I thought OK Ive really arrived at something you know different here you know And Tonto feels right on par with Captain Jack It feels like another Captain Jack to me,

 Are you doing a film about Dr Seuss?,

 Its something yes something were developing With Seusss widow you know Guiseles widow And its a very exciting possibility Because its a sort of combination of live action and ,

 Cat in the Hat?,

 Not Cat in the Hat so much but the characters The characters will certainly have a role,

 Thank you Johnny,

 Thank you What a pleasure What an honor,

 Lets go around then,

 That was fine really yes,

 Yeah since I was about twelve,

 Twelve years old And what are your instruments? Do you play multiple instruments?,

 Mostly guitar,

 Yeahyeah I think it was,

 And then you went where? Where did you go from Kentucky?,

 Not necessarily goodno,

 Oh not good?,

 I was all right,

 But you’d never thought about acting?,

 Never once No,

 That’s crazy isn’t it?,

 Yeahit is now,

 So what was the turning moment? You’re out there in California you have your guitar and suddenly you’re an actor?,

 Well the sudden realization of you know rent Bills You know when that pops in your head you realize that at some point you’ll have to deal with the inevitable,

 But you know that story often goes the other way Somebody goes out there to be an actor and suddenly they’ve got no money so they go to play the guitar to make money You did it just the opposite!,

 Weirdly,

 How did somebody get your first gig if you were a guitar player? Because that means you weren’t actually out there auditioning,

 No uhmy band moved from Florida to Los Angeles,

 What was the name of the band?,

 At the time we were called The Kids,

 The Kids?,

 We actually were kids at the time,

 And so you and The Kids are out there,

 Yeah,

 Well I mean literally you and The Kids are out there and so then what happens?,

 Uh we did some opening act stuff that kind of thing—,

 Who did you work for?,

 Open up for? We did some good shows back at that time—it was like Billy Idol and you know guys like that The Pretenders—,

 Wow,

 Yeah Ramones—,

 Good gig So then all of a sudden you’re—somebody calls and says what? “I saw you onstage with The Kids?”,

 No No I was dead broke you know and I was filling out job applications at variouswell anything Video stores and coffee joints or whatever And a friend of mine who happened to be an actor uhNicolas Cage[smiling] you’ve heard of him—,

 Yeah How did you and Nicolas Cage get to be buddies in those days?,

 He was just sort of around all the people that I was hanging around with and we became pals and he sent me to his agent to—and he said “I think you should try acting” And I met his agent and she sent me to read for something and they hired me,

 What was that? Do you remember what that was?,

 Yeah That was A Nightmare on Elm Street The first one,

 Whoa! [Audience applause] That was pretty good!,

 I was about three when I did that,

 Later we’ve got a man named Bill Carter who is well known in Texas music and southwestern music or what they call Americana I guess—,

 Yeah,

 A singer-songwriter and you met himwhere? Where did your paths meet?,

 Bill and I met—Bill and Ruth Carter—,

 His wife? Partner?,

 Yeah They’re amazing songwriters and I met them when I was doing Gilbert Grape in Austin [audience applause] and we all just hit it off And so they were my kind of saving grace during that period because it was a long movieand so we did the movie and then I moved in with them for a few months,

 Amazing Your movies are interesting movies and huge commercial successes and rarely do you get that combination consistently,

 It’s got nothing to do with me I don’t think,

 All right Johnny Depp is hereI can’t thank you enough for being here It’s a nice night for us and I hope for you as well because you’re here with your friend—,

 Yes sir,

 and we’re going to hear some music later Let’s talk about The Lone Ranger Oh I’m so excited for this movie I really—this is excellent And you’re not the Lone Ranger,

 I’m not,

 You’re his faithful companion Tonto,

 Yeah I play Tonto,

 Do you mind if I just show these?,

 Oh Sure,

 These are great [Holding up a photo of Johnny as Tonto and Armie Hammer as the Ranger] And then the Lone Ranger iswho’s the Lone Ranger?,

 Armie Hammer Yeah—,

 And that’s you,

 —he’s terrific Yeah He’s great,

 Now as I recall the beginning of the—the genesis of the Lone Ranger is he comes from a dark story And is that the tone of your film?,

 Pretty much yeah It comes from a very dark back story anduhhe becomes the Lone Ranger through Tonto’s guidance,

 Did this mean anything to you when you were a kid? Maybe after the radio broadcast but there was a TV show as welldid you like The Lone Ranger in those days?,

 I did I liked watching the series I was always somewhat confused about Tonto’s position I always thought well why does Tonto go in the house and do this? Why is he sending the Indian off to—,

 Right And is that different in this movie?,

 Oh very Yeah It’s very different,

 This looks like a painting This looks like a Charles Russell rendering doesn’t it? That’s fantastic! [Long audience applause] You look like you know what you’re doing on a horse,

 Yeah [Pause] I don’t [Audience laughter] That [indicating the picture] was probably about two-and-a-half seconds before everything went very sideways,

 Well I’m telling you I mean forget the movie—I’d pay ten bucks just to look at this picture [Johnny laughs] Sobut you ride You don’t ride?,

 I haveno no I’ve ridden quite a lot in various movies and stuffand you know growing up in Kentucky you grow up around horses and everything But every horse is different and every movie,

 You had to ride that horse at top speed?,

 Quite a lot Yeah,

 How did that go?,

 It went pretty wellup and to a point Yeah There was one moment in particular where it got unpleasant where the horses had been runningwe’d been running them all day sothey weren’t really interested in slowing down At all So we’re shooting at a different place in the desert where there are all these little [gesturing]bumps and things growing And so my horse that I was on decided to jump a couple of these little obstacles The horse was unaware that the saddle I was wearing to sit on top of it was sort of jerry-riggedkind of faked—,

 It was to give the effect that you were riding bareback?,

 To give the effect that I’m riding bareback So basically it’s not really tight on the horse it’s just enough—,

 Just a little tissue there for you to sit on—,

 A band-aid And when we came down the saddle slipped you know and I went to the left and had the reins here [gesturing] and somehow had the wherewithal to grab the mane of the horseand then the next thing I saw[interrupting himself]all very calm for some reason—I figured that fear would kick in but it didn’t[Audience laughter] I was waitingAll I saw in front of my eyes were these sort of very muscular horse legs and the striations of muscles moving This kind of[pause]death machine And one word popped into my head: hooves You know? Hooves [Audience laughter] In any case hooves Mind the hooves,

 So what do you do when you’re in that position?,

 Well you make a decision Will I go with the beast until someone wrangles it or will I drop? [Audience laughter] It’s a crapshoot,

 Sure And what did you choose?,

 I dropped,

 I mean you knowwe’re being silly about this but you really could have been seriously seriously injured if not killed,

 Horrifically mangled at the very least,

 You landed on your back? Did you get stepped on?,

 I landed on my back Hit the deck pretty hard The one thing that saved me was the horse’s instinct to lift his front legs and go over me,

 He stepped over you?,

 Stepped over me Had he not it was coming straight down into the head,

 Broken ribs strains bruises anything?,

 No He just kind of clipped me with his back legs so it was just a little sore,

 He just “kind of clipped you with his back legs” Yeah a good horse’ll do that Oh my God But honest to God where are the stunt people for heaven’s sakes? You’re Tonto!,

 Yeah,

 You don’t need that,

 That’s the exact same question I asked,

 Johnny I wanted toyou’re now publishingI know you have a love of books and you have published this New York Times bestseller already This is a lost novel from Woody Guthrie?,

 Yeah,

 About the Dust Bowl?,

 Yes,

 How did you find the transcript of this?,

 It came to me through a mutual friend of Hunter Thompson’s and myself this guy named Douglas Brinkley who’s a brilliant writer and historian professorhe’s just amazing So he called me and said “I’ve just been shown the manuscript to Woody Guthrie’s lost novelI think you’re the guy I think we should publish it” And so we went into it and just wanted to make the book as you know beautiful as possible since they’re a dying breed these things,

 You have plans to publish other volumes different things?,

 We have a couple of things in line There’s a thing we’re doing with Bob Dylan which should be interesting,

 And the other thingLast night we had a group on doing sea chanteys,

 Exactly,

 From—the Americans from a collection of sea chanteys which you producedand not only did I not know that you had produced it this is the second collection of sea chanteys—,

 Yeah “Rogues Gallery” and—,

 This is the “Son of Rogues Gallery”,

 “Son of Rogues”,

 This is music that you came to when you were doing the Pirates of the Caribbean series?,

 Yeah on Pirates 1 I was listening to a lot of sea chanteys just to stay in the feel of this and Gore and I—the director and I thought Wow wouldn’t it be great to have contemporary artists do this stuff?,

 Anytime I’ve seen you—in a trailer at your home in a hotel room—you always have at least one guitar with you You sometimes talk while strumming a guitar How connected are you with music?,

 It’s still my first love as much as it ever was since I was a little kid and first picked up a guitar and tried to figure out how to make the thing go Going into acting was an odd deviation from a particular road that I was on in my late teens early 20s because I had no desire no interest really in it at all I was a musician and I was a guitarist and that’s what I wanted to do But because of that deviation and because I don’t do it for a living maybe I still have been able to maintain that kind of innocent love for it The weird thing is I think I approach my work the same way I approached guitar playing—looking at a character like a song If you think of expression musically—it goes from wherever it comes from inside to your fingers and on to that fretboard and then on to the amplifier through whatever It’s the same kind of thing that’s required here with acting: What was the author’s intent? What can I add to it that maybe someone else won’t add to it? It’s not necessarily a question of how many notes but a question of what do the notes express and what does a slight bend do,

 I overheard someone in your camp—maybe it was on the set of The Rum Diary or maybe it was The Tourist—talking about how eager you were to get back to Captain Jack and about how much Jack was like you How do you feel when you enter into the skin of Captain Jack?,

 Free—free to be irreverent I think it’s like unlocking a part of yourself and freeing this part of yourself to just be—what do they call it?—the id or whatever just to bejust to be under whatever circumstances The closest thing that I can compare it to was having known Hunter Thompson really well—we were very very close—and witnessing him because I studied him so deeply and lived with him for a period of time to try to become Raoul Duke to try to become Hunter There was a certain freedom that he had or control or command of the situation—there was never anything that he couldn’t get through Verbally he was just so clever and so quick and so free and he didn’t give a rat’s ass about what the repercussions were,

 He was the revolutionary’s Johnny Carson I mean he always had a punch line,

 Somebody once asked him “What is the sound of one hand clapping Hunter?” and he smacked him Captain Jack was kind of like that for me an opening up of this part of yourself that is somewhat—you know there is a little Bugs Bunny in all of us,

 Young kids love—really love—the Captain And who is more mystically mischievous and brilliant in his own way than Bugs Bunny?,

 At the time I had been watching nothing but cartoons with my daughter—with Lily Rose I hadn’t seen a grown-up film in forever It was all cartoons all those great old Warner Bros things And I thought Jesus the parameters here are so much wider and more forgiving in terms of character These cartoon characters could get away with anything And I thought They’re beloved by 3-year-olds and 93-year-olds How do you do that? How do you get there? That was kind of the start,

 I also see a little bit of John Barrymore in Captain Jack There’s humor and often a feyness He keeps his intelligence in his own little treasure chest He doesn’t really want people to comprehend that he knows everything,

 He has already assessed the situation,

 What were you reading to inform you about Captain Jack’s life or his lifestyle?,

 I was reading a lot of books about early pirates There was one book in particular that was really helpful called Under the Black Flag You realize that those guys were—you either loved it or you were press-ganged and you didn’t One of the things that helped me most with Captain Jack was a book by Bernard Moitessier and it’s where I found the last line for the first Pirates movie The writers were stumped and they’d say Well what about this? And nothing seemed to click I was reading this Moitessier book on sailing the earth and he had written about how the ultimate for a sailor was the horizon and to be able to attain that horizon which you never get to which is why it keeps pushing you forward I thought That’s it! That’s it! So I went to them and said I’ve got a line for you: “Bring me that horizon” And they looked at it and went Nah that’s not it But about 45 minutes later they came to me and went That’s the line,

 Because delivered in a certain way,

 Yeah—“Bring me that horizon” That’s what they all want That’s what all those guys want Get me that horizon And you never get there,

 How did Disney feel about Captain Jack? He does have a wisp of controversy about him,

 It was a totally different regime over there at the time They couldn’t stand him They just couldn’t stand him I think it was Michael Eisner the head of Disney at the time who was quoted as saying “He’s ruining the movie” It was that extreme—memos and paper trails and madness and phone calls and agents and lawyers and people screaming and me getting phone calls direct from you know upper-echelon Disney-ites going What’s wrong with him? Is he you know like some kind of weird simpleton? Is he drunk? By the way is he gay? Is he this? Is he that? And so I actually told this woman who was the Disney-ite that called me about all that stuff and asked me the questions I said to her “But didn’t you know that all my characters are gay?” Which really made her nervous,

The role of Frank in The Tourist is so different from the Hatter or the Captain—more subtle Characters like him—who seem to have less that you can grasp—I would think would be harder to do,

 The great challenge of a character like Frank for me is that he’s Everyman you know Mr Ordinary—not a simpleton just ordinary He’s a math teacher I was always fascinated by people who are considered completely normal because I find them the weirdest of all,

 So where did you find Frank?,

 He was sort of a combo platter for me from certain people I’ve known over the years I knew an accountant who would travel—he was super-straight very very straight guy—and he would travel all over the world to photograph places that had street signs or businesses that had the same name as his last name He’d go to Italy he’d go to Shanghai and he’d take photographs That was his kick,

 He had an eccentricity that no one sees Everyone sees the eccentricities of an artist But eccentricities like Frank’s are so subtle and so particular,

 It was guys like that that I thought about Frank for example who had quit smoking could be absolutely fascinated with that electronic cigarette and the moving parts of it and being able to really explain it to someone in great detail,

 Frank has some really nice pajamas Cotton Light blue Do you wear pajamas?,

 Occasionally I do Occasionally when it’s cold,

 Do they have feet on them?,

 I don’t have the feet I have not gone for footed pajamas yet However I’m not—I wouldn’t you know withdraw the idea One of the finest nights of sleep that I ever had after a huge workload was in a pair of pajamas that Julian Schnabel gave me I hadn’t worn pajamas since I was about three And I actually slept in them They were somehow so comforting His wife made them That was the moment when I became completely square,

 Well I don’t know I’ve also seen your Miami Dolphins socks—although that might be a secret,

 You have a pair too! There are no secrets now We’re in this together,

 We have another dirty little secret A Monkees song,

 Oh “Daydream Believer” It’s a great song I don’t care what anyone says,

 “Daydream Believer” came on the radio when we were driving to the set It was a moment of total happiness It’s a pure happy little song What bad thing can you say about it?,

 I know I know It’s OK to like “Daydream Believer” There’s nothing wrong with a guilty pleasure from time to time Know what I mean? It’s “Daydream Believer” I’m justifying my own flag,

 A Monkee and I have the same birthday,

 Is it Micky Dolenz?,

 No it’s actually two Monkees Mike and Davy I used to be horrified by that fact but now I don’t care anymore I have the same birthday as Bo Diddley Rudyard Kipling and Paul Bowlesand two Monkees,

 That’s pretty good That’s a good balance,

 Getting back to The Tourist from what I saw on set the atmosphere seemed fraught with mischief,

 Angelina—we’d met basically on this film Meeting her and getting to know her was a real pleasant surprise and I say that with the best meaning just in the sense that she’s this quite you know famous and I mean poor thing dogged by paparazzi her and her husband Brad you know and all their kids and their wonderful life but they are plagued byso you don’t know what to expect really You don’t know what she might be like—if she has any sense of humor at all I was so pleased to find that she is incredibly normal and has a wonderfully kind of dark perverse sense of humor And because here we are working together in this situation where you could really—there are times when you see how ridiculous is this life how ludicrous it is you know leaving your house every morning and being followed by paparazzi or having to hide sometimes not even being able to talk to each other in public because someone will take a photograph and it will be misconstrued and turned into some other shit,

 On set I told her that she looked beautiful and she explained to me about all the different people it takes to make that possible—as if she really isn’t I found Angelina interesting If you talk about her beauty she scoffs If you mention a cause she invites you to take a stand,

 That’s the thing with Angie I mean you look at her and you go OK: “goddess” “movie icon” In 30 years people will still be going “Oh my God” Elizabeth Taylor kind of territory And she has got that no question about it But like anything it’s the way she deals with it She’s so down to earth and so bright and so real I’ve had the honor and the pleasure and gift of having known Elizabeth Taylor for a number of years Who’s a real broad You know you sit down with her she slings hash she sits there and cusses like a sailor and she’s hilarious Angie’s got the same kind of thing you know the same approach,

 Something I’ve always wondered about is: these people that you become for us or make flesh in a film—do they revisit you ever? Are you able to discard them? What happens to them?,

 They’re all still there which on some level can’t be the healthiest thing in the world But no they’re all still there I always picture it as this chest of drawers in your body—Ed Wood is in one the Hatter is in another Scissorhands is in another They stick with you Hunter is certainly in there—you know Raoul Duke The weirdest thing is that I can access them They’re still very close to the surface,

 It must be difficult when you have multiple personalities in one of them like the Hatter has What does he say “It’s crowded in here”?,

 “I don’t like it in here It’s terribly crowded” But they all somehow have their place They have come to terms with each other I suppose,

 When you’re playing someone—when you’re really deep within a character—have you ever had a dream that you felt was not your dream? Do your characters dream within you?,

 I’ve certainly had dreams where I was the character Sweeney was like that There were a lot of dark Sweeney dreams And certainly The Libertine playing John Wilmot,

 I would think that Wilmot would be the one who would most desire to rear his head He was a real human being It’s one thing to interpret a character in literature or someone in fiction But to have to channel someone who was a living person Did you find that process different?,

 It’s definitely different The first thing is the responsibility You have a responsibility to that person and the legacy and memory of that person So especially playing someone like John Wilmot the Earl of Rochester because I always felt he was this great great poet who was never acknowledged as a great poet but looked upon as a satirist or some silly guy who hung around the court of King Charles II I never believed he got his due He was a renegade a brilliant poet who was incredibly brave I felt this very strong responsibility to play him right—so much so that I became obsessed I read everything I knew everything about him I went to the places he’d lived I went to the place where he died I perused his actual letters in the British Library and found his words and made notes and used them in the script Without wanting to sound all kind of New Agey I do believe that he paid me at least a few visits,

 When you spouted a few lines of poetry to Samantha Morton who played Elizabeth Barry in the movie—that was my introduction to Wilmot’s work to his poetry And I noticed in Alice when the Hatter recites “Jabberwocky” that you have a gift for giving us the full measure of a poet’s work It is really quite difficult Could you imagine doing a recording of works of poetry?,

 I don’t know It’s daunting because you don’t know exactlyI mean you can decipher the intent and you can kind of swim around in the guts of it but you just don’t know how the poet would have wanted it read,

 Yes but that’s no different than Glenn Gould having to anticipate how Bach would want his work played I thought the Hatter’s reading of “Jabberwocky” was luminous Yesterday you read me a poem written by the Elephant Man I didn’t know he wrote poetry The poem you recited was heartbreaking How did you come to find it?,

 I made an appointment at the hospital where they had his remains His skeleton is there a plaster mask is there and his hat and veil and all this other stuff is there And right on the wall next to him is this gorgeous poem that he wrote about himself and about his life: “Dragging this vile body / Round the years / I am not what first appears / A senseless freak / Devoid of hope or tears” This guy was deep and so so gifted,

 I’ve seen The Libertine a number of times The cinematography the direction the script—it was all so beautiful The costumes the casting the women—they were superb John Malkovich was a great person for you to work off of But it seemed buried as a film,

 It was buried no question It was buried horribly It was a conflict within the ranks I wanted to go to the artist Banksy the English graffiti artist I was going to make a plea to him What I wanted was the image the spray-painted image of John Wilmot’s face to show up here and there simply with the line from the movie the phrase “You will not like me” “You will not like me”—I thought That’s the way to go with something like this But the reaction was “Banksy who?”,

 Do you have any actors that you studied from the past actors from any era who were helpful either in a specific role or just in general? ,

 The guys I always adored were mostly the silent-film actors Buster Keaton first Lon Chaney Sr and Chaplin of course—those three for me And John Barrymore The gods: those are the gods And then you’ve got the people that came out of that Paul Muni certainlyBut Marlon it wasn’t until Marlon Brando came along thatit was revolutionary it just changed everything The work he was doing Streetcar—completely different fucking animal And everybody changed their approach from that moment on,

 He was bigger than—I don’t know how to say it—it was almost like the screen could not contain him Does that make sense?,

 Absolutely I don’t know what the fuck it is or was but at that time—especially at that time—he had too much And the shape of his face and his nose and his—and the distance between his forehead and his eyebrows and whatever was going on for whatever genetic reason or whatever He was placed in that spot for that particular thing And man he cranked it He just absolutely owned it,

 It’s interesting when one individual—whether it’s Michelangelo Coltrane Bob Dylan Jackson Pollock—they’re so inspiring and they help beget almost a whole school but no one can touch them They have this place of kingship but also solitude,

 And Marlon hated it He hated it which is probably why he rejected the whole idea of it you know and made fun of it But I know it’s bullshit I know he was capable of the work and worked hard when he did the work I saw him do it you know He did care,

 Earlier you mentioned those three greats the silent-film greats You’re a master of language voice script words And yet you chose three silent-film actors,

 The amazing thing about those guys is that they didn’t have the luxury of language So what they were doing what they were feeling what they were trying to express had to come out through being had to be alive had to be in there behind the eyes Their body had to express it their very being had to express it,

 Throughout your life you seem to have had beautiful relationships with a succession of mentors—Marlon Hunter Allen Ginsberg You hold these people with you Is that something that has just come your way? Or is it something that you seek in life?,

 I think it’s probably a combination It’s never been a conscious sort of searching but it did happen with these guys The combination probably goes back to memories of my grandfather We were very very close and I lost him I was about nine,

 Is it your grandfather you have tattooed on your arm?,

 Yeah Jim He was a wonderful model He drove a bus during the day and ran moonshine at night He was a Robert Mitchum type a man’s man He just said things as they were He’d call a spade a spade—and piss on you if you don’t like it He was also of a different era—I mean a radically different era as were some of the other guys that we’ve talked about like Marlon and Hunter and even Keith [Richards] to some degree and Allen certainly I really believe it was a better time I really believe that at a certain point if you’re born in ‘60-something or whatever you got ripped off—you know what I mean? I always felt like I was meant to have been born in another era another time,

 I was thinking back on Edward Scissorhands—he has this father figure and mentor Vincent Price’s character You told me a story once about Vincent Price,

 We were doing Scissorhands and Vincent was playing the inventor—essentially my father in the film And he was a decent man He was able to move around He was cool He was old,

 Was that his last film?,

 I think it was yes I think it was his last,

 Such a beautiful film to end with,

 And the same kind of genre that he dwelled in for a long time I adored him As did Tim a long time before me So we spent time together hung out I was totally enamored And I had this volume of Edgar Allan Poe Tales of Mystery and Imagination that I wanted to show him just show him you know because I love the illustrations by Harry Clarke I brought it to Vincent and we were sitting in his trailer He says Oh yes this is wonderful it’s a wonderful book He was leafing beautifully through these great heavy pages And he found “The Tomb of Ligeia” and started to read from it And he read about half a page aloud maybe And then he closed the book and continued He knew it verbatim,

 Speaking of books I was thinking about the letters and manuscripts you have—Dylan Thomas Kerouac Rimbaud Can you remember the first of these that you obtained and how that came about?,

 It was 1991 and I was finishing a film called Arizona Dream in New York And I wanted to take a trip to Lowell Massachusetts to see Kerouac’s town I’d read everything and been inundated with the Kerouac thing And so I went there and hooked up with John Sampas who is Kerouac’s wife’s brother We talked He took me around the town We went to various bars and went to his house spent a couple of days like that At the time it was prior to all that stuff being sold off He gave me access total access to Kerouac’s things He just opened up—bam! I read the Book of Dreams that was under his bed I read it cover to cover There it was like right there in front of me,

 In his handwriting?,

 Handwriting watercolors—the Book of Dreams It was right there little notepads tiny little steno notebooks that he carried in his back pocket I read cover to cover as many as I could And opened up suitcases of his that hadn’t been opened for years All these amazing things John Sampas gave me a coat so we could walk to the cemetery to visit Kerouac’s grave And the coat he put on me was Jack’s A black raincoat three-quarter length slight check in it I reached into the pockets In the right-hand pocket there was a tissue just some old wadded-up tissue And on the left-hand side there was an old matchbook And I thought you know OK I’ve touched these It’s like the Smithsonian Institution was in my pockets you know?,

 Are you reading anything right now? Well you’re always reading so I should say what are you reading right now?,

 Between scripts I’m reading The Thin Man the Dashiell Hammett book to see what we can mine from it That’s something that would be Rob [Marshall] directing and me playing the Nick part My hope is that Penélope [Cruz] would play the part of Nora,

 And what script are you reading?,

 The most recent draft of Dark Shadows That’s something I want to do The script is close now really close and you know it’s just a question of myself and Tim and the writer basically the three of us getting together and signing off on various scenarios But it’s really gotten good In the last three weeks it’s gotten fuckin’ good,

 Do you ever think of doing plays? I think it would be wonderful to see you work live,

 I do I do I do The bitter pill that I swallowed was with Marlon who asked how many movies I did a year And I said I don’t know—three? He said You ought to slow down kid You’ve got to slow down ‘cause we only have so many faces in our pockets And then he went on to say Why don’t you just take a year and go and study Shakespeare or go and study Hamlet Go and work on Hamlet and play that part Play that part before you’re too old I thought Well yeah yeah I know Hamlet Great What a great part great play you know this and that And then the killer came He said “I never did it I never got the chance to do it Why don’t you go and do it?” He was the one that should’ve done it and he didn’t He didn’t So what he was trying to tell me was: play that fucking part man Play that part before you’re too long in the tooth Play it And I would like to I’d really really like to,

 Tim Burton says the dark films youve made together have been a form of therapy. Would you agree?,

 I guess it is kind of therapeutic to go in and make an ass of yourself and get paid for it. Theres something to be said for that. As an actor with any character you play you have to bring as much of your own truth to the character as possible. And then you make an ass of yourself.,

 How easy was it getting into the character of Willy Wonka?,

 Well obviously were all very lucky to have the book as our source material. Using Roald Dahls work was an amazing help in building the character. And then it was really just down to conversations with Tim. We talked about various things like memories of growing up of childrens show hosts. That strange cadence with which they spoke to children “Hello kiddies;” and game show hosts with that kind of mask they put on like a perpetual grimace. We went from there.,

 Did you draw on any one person?,

 There was this guy called Captain Kangaroo. Even then it was strange but if you go back now and watch it its really out there. He had his pal Mr. Green Jeans and Bunny Rabbit. So it was memories of watching those guys as a child the game show guys who were always smiling. But no one specific.,

 What about the resemblance between Willy Wonka and Michael Jackson?,

 Honestly when we were doing the film it never dawned on me that there would be any comparisons made. I dont know what more I can say about that.,

 What else did you do to develop the character?,

 For me when Im reading a script I start getting images you know—ideas start coming into my head so I write everything down. The hairdo I saw early on but it took a long time before I could see or hear Wonka. I dont know thats pretty much it. You build layer upon layer as you find him. Even when we started shooting it probably took me about ten days to really feel like I clicked with the guy. The false teeth were very helpful.,

 Have your children seen all your films?,

 Some of them yeah. Im not sure my kids are ready for all of them. They saw Charlie and the Chocolate Factory which made me nervous because I was scared they were going to come home and just go “Nah Dad better luck next time.” But they came home quoting it which was really nice.,

 If you were as poor as Charlie Bucket is in the film do you think you could be happy?,

 When I was growing up we werent particularly overflowing with money. I never expected to last so long in this racket to be honest. I always expected to go back to playing guitar and pumping gas or whatever. And it still could happen. As long as you have the ability to breathe and life for your kids and your girl you just keep moving forward.,

 So whats next for you?,

 Well at the moment Im on hiatus from shooting Pirates 2 and 3. Thats going well so far—I havent been fired which is good. And I made a film last year called The Libertine which is coming out next in December I think. Thats pretty much it at the moment.,

 Have you always been interested in the dark side of life?,

 Yeah yeah. Im interested in extremes of all kinds you know. The dark side the light side the negative and the positive. I dont know why. Human behavior really is the most fascinating thing.,

 What do you think of the view that The Ripper was the very first tabloid star?,

 I agree with it. He was perversely elevated to the status of celebrity. It was the first time that had happened. The Ripper case in a way gave birth to tabloid journalism.,

 From Hell is a classic London story. But where did you film it?,

 The Czech Republic! I really dont know why. All I know is that when I arrived in the Czech Republic they drove me about 30-40 minutes outside Prague to the studio and they had built 8-10 blocks of Whitechapel 1888 in staggering detail in the middle of a field.,

 So what was it like to be standing there to suddenly be transported back in time?,

 It was extremely bizarre. The day before Id been to Whitechapel in London and had visited the 10 Bells and the various murder sites the church and the general neighborhood. And then the next day Im standing in the exact same spot except one hundred and something years earlier. It was so beautifully done. The detail was amazing.,

 Do you mean you went on The Ripper Tour?,

 Kind of. I went with one of the experts the Ripper-ologists. He took me on the walk and explained all the details because a lot of the murder sites are now gone. There are buildings on top of them.,

 We hear that you hang out in London quite a lot and we were wondering why you particularly like the city?,

 Its easy to like it just look at it! Its an amazing place amazing people. When we did Sleepy Hollow I was here for six months and that was one of the greatest times Ive ever had. Its beautiful its got great history great people an interesting culture the list is endless.,

 And is it right that youre going to open a bar here?,

 I just heard that today and thats the first Id heard of it! A couple of people have said to me “Hows the bar going?” and I thought they meant The Viper Room in Los Angeles. Im always coming across small fictions like that about me. Its part of the deal I guess.,

 So lets talk about Robbie Coltrane—youve said hes your hero—why do you think hes such a cool guy?,

 Hes the perfect example of what a man should be. Hes a great man a loyal man hes a great actor a great comedian a beautiful friend a beautiful father. Hes amazing. Im going to call him BAFTA Coltrane from now on. Im sure hell clean up at the Academy Awards.,

 On the set of From Hell you had Robbie from Harry Potter and Ian Holm from Lord Of The Rings. Did you find out much insider gossip from those films?,

 Ian showed me these photographs of himself in his prosthetic makeup which was pretty impressive. And I got a few Harry Potter stories out of old Coltrane. But I still havent seen the films yet. I dont go to the movies so much. Theyll come around at some point. I prefer the comfort of ignorance in terms of the industry. I dont like knowing which movies are making money. I dont like knowing what the new thing is whos popular whos not popular. I find great comfort in not knowing these things.,

 What interested you about From Hell?,

 I thought the script was amazing and I’m a big fan of the Hughes Brothers. I loved their last film (American Pimp) and I loved working with them. I also got the chance to smoke a lot in this movie like in Blow. I don’t need an excuse to smoke in a film.,

 You were interested in Jack the Ripper as a child?,

 Yes I was very fascinated by the subject of Jack the Ripper I was obsessed maybe I was too interested in him at such a young age. From then on I just found as much information on the subject as I could over the years. It’s the first recorded serial killer in history and the fact that’s it’s never been properly solved is really fascinating. Nothing like this had happened before on such a large scale and it’s still an unsolved case and it’s a case that will likely never fully be solved.,

 Abberline is a very sick tortured man in the film? Tell us how you approached the character.,

 Even in the deepest and darkest kinds of things I try to find some humor and extract it. The character I play Abberline feels like he sees demons and visions in his search for Jack the Ripper. He’s a very damaged man so in a way from my point of view it would make sense to show all of his scars and weaknesses. He has all of these demons he abuses drugs you show the addictions and the demons—as well as the hunt for the killer.,

 You did a lot of research for this role didn’t you?,

 One of the things I was able to do was actually go and visit Whitechapel and see the real places where the killings took place. I also got to talk to all of these ‘Ripperologists’ and hear all of these theories about who Jack the Ripper may have been. One of the Jack the Ripper experts he took me to all of the notorious landmarks where all the murders happened.,

 What did the Hughes Brothers bring to the film?,

 They knew every theory in the film. They’re great. They know everything about what they’re doing. They study scenes. They told me that they had reconstructed Whitechapel for the movie but I didn’t know just how far they had gone. It turns out you could see seven or eight blocks of the East End of London. It felt like stepping back into time. I was so impressed with the research they had done for the film. It was like watching someone solve a hard equation.,

 Why is the legend of the Jack the Ripper still so fascinating?,

 It was the first case where a faceless killer had been elevated to the status of pulp icon. He became a worldwide curiosity.,

 So From Hell was a much happier experience than The Astronaut’s Wife and The Ninth Gate?,

 Yes.,

 Tell us a little about working with Tim Burton.,

 I’d love to work with Tim again. Tim’s a true artist very true to his artistic vision to his emotions. He’s proved that you can do things differently and still be successful. On Sleepy Hollow I thought I was going to get fired because I didn’t think there was any way they were going to let me play the character that way but Tim was very supportive. The same was true with the Hughes Brothers. Anything they did I’d work with them again.,

 Jerry Seinfeld. He has kept one of Hollywoods most buzzed about secrets until tonight. The comic reveals the true identity,

 Its like not even know just total shock.,

 Someone weve only read about.,

 It was a nom de plume.,

 One of the funniest men on the planet is here.,

 I mean I think missing in the show is a menu.,

 Good evening. I have to say this? Jerry Seinfeld is an actor author director and comedian.,

 Keep going.,

 Im telling you you may not know who he is. He is making his Broadway directing debut with comedian Colin Quinns one-man show Long Story Short History of the World in 75 Minutes. And he wrote the forward to an all-new Letters From A Nut one of the funniest books you will ever read. And tonight he will reveal the secret author a little later Jerry has been a frequent guest long-time friend to this show. Watch. Well show you some examples.,

 Look at this piece of junk. Look at it Give me a camera. Look at this. This is like you know this like a 4.95 opening act. Youre a headliner now. This is a nice weather map you have here. This looks like a game of risk.,

 What about financial success? I mean you dont have financial worries?,

 No.,

 Hows that changed you? You can buy anything you see.,

 Yes.,

 OK.,

 I want that clock. Heres the question.,

 Go ahead.,

 Whos the victim? Wheres the victim here? Youre all a victim.,

 This looks like QVC doesnt it? What else Jerry? What else?,

 Thats not all you get. You get the knives.,

 What do you make of our earlier conversation which bumped you 20 minutes?,

 Well I cant tell you how flattered I am that it takes the presidents genitals to push me back 20 minutes. I mean thats how big a star I am. Lets tell them about this movie. That shot of you and Cattenburg (ph) nose to nose,

 Historically.,

 I have not seen that since I left Hebrew school. You know I have a Larry King in the human world too.,

 Its a common name. Next week on the larry king.,

 No no I mean he looks like you. He has a show with suspenders and different color of dots behind him,

 Next week on the Larry king.,

 Old-guy glasses and these quotes along the bottom from the guest youre watching even though you just heard him. Its not even a new one. Do you tape this in your luggage? Oh boy. What a budget. Goodbye clock. Get another one.,

 We used to have a little clock in there. We used it frequently until Seinfelds last appearance then we couldnt afford another. Why did you take our clock?,

 Larry this is my final appearance on the larry king LIVE show.,

 Because larry king LIVE leaves in December.,

 No. You will be here. Im going.,

 Oh I see.,

 And because this is my final appearance.,

 No.,

 I have in my hand.,

 What?,

 A clock that Im going to give you. Its the cheapest clock I could find. Its $3. But I wanted a clock that looked most like the clock that you usually have on this show which I could never even conceive that you dont know what time it is or you need toso Im replacing the clocks that I have been stealing all these years. Im putting one down. And it got a snooze. Can you get a shot of that? It got a snooze because when you get older thats what counts.,

 This clock shall be a permanent part of larry king LIVE. It shall be embellished in our hearts.,

 At the Smithsonian.,

 And will go to Smithsonian when we send the set over. By the way what prompted you to take it the first time?,

 Its just annoying that a big-time big-shot guy like you has a piece of Chazarai (ph) like that. It offended me. Chazarai by the way is an inexpensive item.,

 Thats correct. Youre going to put the rumors to rest tonight about who wrote Letters From A Nut.,

 Yes.,

 Who was identified as Ted L. Nancy which of course was a nom de plume.,

 It was a nom of plume. Now this idea of this character started 15 years ago. And when the idea arose we decided to keep it a secret who was writing these letters. ,

 And tonight well meetTonight youre going to meet the person who has conceived of this entire character. And it was really thought ofwe did it as kind of a gag just for ourselves to have fun and the books took off. And theres been I think four or five of them now. Theyve best sellers and it was never intended to be that. The trouble with the book and just called trouble is you cant read it without breaking up. I mean well read some letters later. This guy fiction (ph) writes crazy letters to people.,

 And they answer him.,

 He writes to hotels businesses corporations.,

 Because people are so afraid of offending a customer now. No matter what he asks them for they say well we dont know if we can have 10000,

 Well reveal that in a little while. Why did you choose larry king LIVE to reveal it?,

 I have to be honest with you.,

 Please.,

 This is the funniest show on TV.,

 What?,

 This show makes no sense. That you sit here and ask these questions night after night and nobody answers them and nobody cares. And it goes on and on and on and you sit here and you look like youre ready to order. This is what this show looks like to me on TV is a guy in a deli waiting to order. To me the only thing missing on the show is a menu. I always think youre going to look up and go is the corned beef lean? Is it lean?,

 So you have chosen us?,

 Because this show is funny. Do I want to do the 60 Minutes funny?,

 No.,

 No.,

 So you see me with President Carter you laugh?,

 Yes.,

 You laugh? ,

 Yes. Because itsyou knowyoure like an uncle that cornered somebody at a Thanksgiving dinner and you just start peppering them with questions and theyre lookingtheyre holding a piece of cake and they cant get away. And you keep asking them questions and theyre avoiding the answers and thats who you are. Youre like an annoying relative that people love but youre annoying. OK. Youby the way I was honored to appear in Bee Movie. I loved you in Bee Movie. Let me tell you why you were in Bee Movie. First of all you have been in more movies ,

 26 I think.,

 Than any talk show host.,

 Correct. I have that record.,

 And that is because the show makes no sense.,

 Thats why they want me.,

 Thats why they want you. But theres something about we thought if there was a fantasy universe where bees lives when talked like people no matter what universe you could conceive of there would be some version of Larry King there. Thats how Omni present you are.,

 Omni present?,

 Youre so much a part of culture. The idea of a world with no Larry King is inconceivable which is why CNN will change their mind before this season is over before what is it December 18th?,

 16th.,

 16th. It will go to the 18th. Thats how strong youre,

 Youre on a role man. By the way you directed me in Bee Movie.,

 I did.,

 And of all the movies I do you were the most maybe next to Warren Beatty in Bulworth who drove me crazy.,

 Right.,

 You were the most involved director changing scripts little lines.,

 Im a nuts. ,

 We were whole day with it.,

 Yes. I noticed. II wantedI wantedyou werent quite giving me Larry King.,

 Thats right. You needed more.,

 Yes. Its too much Larry not enough King. Too much King. Less Larry.,

 Will you do a sequel?,

 To Bee Movie?,

 Yes.,

 No.,

 Why not?,

 I loved it. In case you havent noticed if you look at my career and you see what I do being a standup comedian aside I do things and then I just walk away. Have you noticed that? And I never go back. Do you think Ill do another sitcom?,

 No.,

 No. Can we roll the clip by the way of you asking me it was my favorite one one of your producers asked me what was my favorite moment of being on larry king. My favorite moment was when you asked me if my show was canceled. Do you remember that?,

 And you got ticked.,

 No. I was joking.,

 You were acting yes.,

 But it was a big internet sensation you know.,

 I know.,

 Because people thought that I really was upset.,

 But yes you did it pretty good and then we were on Conan the next night. Both of us were on Conan.,

 Thats right.,

 Thats too funny. The cast of Seinfeld recently reunited on Curb Your Enthusiasm. Lets take a look at some behind the scenes footage as they all walk onto the set.,

 It was a year ago.,

 What was that like to go back?,

 It was mind boggling. It was mind boggling because you know they rebuilt the set and we were all there. And so you know this is 12 years ago. You walk away. Its like if you go back to your old neighborhood you can see the neighborhood but if you go back to your old house its not the same. So it was the same. So we got to really go back in time.,

 How do you explain the success of Curb Your Enthusiasm?,

 Just really a show.,

 Its brilliant.,

 Its a brilliant show. And Larry has all the gifts you know? He knows how to write. He knows how to cast. He is funny himself you know. Its one of my favorite shows.,

 How did Seinfeld come about?,

 It came about because NBC had talked to me about doing a show and I was standing in catch a rising star on first avenue in 1988 with Larry David and I said so NBC is talking to me about you know that they might want to do something and I cant think of anything to do. So then we go across the street to a Korean deli and were buying some food to eat some you know junk you know chips and things and we start making fun of everything. And he goes this is what the show should be two comedians just talking. And thats what we started with. ,

 And did NBCwas it a hit get-go? No. No. Four years. Four years. Really?,

 Yes. It had good demographics. In other words we had a good audience that was sort of whatever the advertisers want but we did have very low ratings very low ratings. Very low ratings.,

 Now you continue now to do your standup? You play Vegas? How many times a year do you go?,

 Oh I do about 100 shows a year.,

 That many?,

 Yes. All over the country.,

 New material?,

 Not all the time. As much as I can.,

 But a lot? You write all your own,

 I write all my own stuff. Yes. Do you want to hear a joke?,

 Yes. Do a joke. Do a joke. Go ahead. Say something funny. A-ha.,

 Thats the worst setup for a comedian and you know it.,

 I know that. You cant do that.,

 Any guy in a deli knows that you dont tell a comedian be funny.,

 You got me back in the deli.,

 I love you in the deli. I dont know why this is not a deli set. There should be sandwiches here and waiters walking with around. Because thats where you belong in a deli.,

 This is the world.,

 Speaking of food.,

 Im going to get to that in a minute.,

 Sorry to go out of order. You want to hear a joke? Two peanuts are walking long one was a salted.,

 Letters From A Nut by Ted L. Nancy with an introduction by you.,

 Yes.,

 Explain this. Is there a guy named Ted Nancy?,

 There is a guy but Ive never met him.,

 But he gets big cut of this book.,

 Yes. Well I know a guy who knows him and thats where I,

 You have never met him.,

 I have never met.,

 The hero of this book?,

 Yes.,

 He wrote all the letters?,

 Yes.,

 And that was a little falsehood there because in a minute youre going to meet who the real Ted Nancy is with a new edition of Letters From A Nut. But first another first.,

 One of the things thats great about being me,

 Among many yes.,

 Among many is I get to present people that I love that have great talents and great things and I getI use you to do this.,

 Im your prop?,

 Yes.,

 OK.,

 I wouldnt say prop. I would say youre my,

 Im your idol.,

 Youre my idol.,

 OK. ,

 If that helps you. So tonight is three people that Im really here to talk about because I dont talk about myself. Not about me. I know. And this for the first time my wife had a huge hit book.,

 Unbelievable.,

 Two years ago called Deceptively Delicious. I thought of the title but she did everything else and it was a giant hit and shes finally come out with a sequel. Now I know that your wife loves this book.,

 Loved it.,

 And I know that you drove all around San Francisco trying to find a copy.,

 The last copy they had.,

 I got the first copy of the sequel which has never been seen anywhere before this appearance on larry king LIVE. Here it s Double Delicious and its signed from my wife to your wife Shawn warmest regards Jessica. And thats for you Larry.,

 Wow. Oh and this book is in stores when?,

 I think you can buy it now.,

 OK. Jessica Seinfeld Double Delicious you saw it here first.,

 Shes not here.,

 I know.,

 Shes going to be on Oprah next month.,

 Oh good.,

 Yes.,

 Ive heard of that show too.,

 Yes.,

 She goes to Oprah you come to me. I like that.,

 Yes. Another one gone. Nobody can hold a job around here.,

 Were going to do a show together a network in a deli.,

 But the most exciting thing tonight go ahead.,

 All right. Thatsall these are nutty letters. Jerry whos with you here?,

 Now the man sitting next to me the reason I am bringing him out tonight is because in the 15 years since we have been doing this the internet has started up and a lot of people have been out there taking credit for these letters.,

 Oh really?,

 And saying I wrote the books and theyre for sale on my site and because of the internet and you know what thats all about it was time to reveal the mystery. Its his fifth book coming out. Ladies and gentlemen the real author of Letters From A Nut is Barry P. Marder sitting next to me who has been a colleague of mine for over 25 years.,

 Colleague in what way? He writes?,

 Hes a comedian a comedy writer.,

 That is from Jerrys show The Marriage Ref. Madonna Larry David Ricky Gervais what qualified them to give advice? How did you come up with this?,

 I just love talking about marriage fights. I find them funny and I love to hear how people respond to other peoplesother peoples marital issues are comedy for the world.,

 Not yours?,

 Not mine no. And not yours.,

 No not mine. But theirs.,

 Theirs. Anybody else it makes you laugh. So I just thought it would be fun to have a show with funny people coming on and talking about marriage. It seems to provoke natural comedy. I love that show.,

 When is it on?,

 Its coming back on NBC I think the beginning of next year January of next year.,

 Its not on the early winter right?,

 I dont know what they do but they are starting to shoot them now the next season.,

 Explain television to me.,

 It is like,

 Like Seinfeld you lasted four years without being a hit? Couldnt happen today?,

 I dont know about that. Dont you believe quality always survives somehow?,

 You really believe that?,

 You busted out laughing at that? Quality survives somehow always. Not always but most of the time. Dont you believe in that? ,

 A television network would stick with a show havingAnything thats good eventually somehow Finds its way.,

 You have to believe in that or you dont go into this business right?,

 I guess so yeah. It can be disappointing when you have to deal with,

 I have never been disappointed fortunately.,

 You have always had success?,

 Always yes.,

 How do you deal with the suits in the business?,

 The suits? The lawsuits or the guys wearing suits?,

 The guys up at the,

 I agree with them. Its like a wife. You agree. You say that makes perfect sense. From now on we are going to do it that way. And then you do whatever you want.,

 Of course the suits dont watch.,

 They dont know. They dont even watch their own network.,

 So you agree with them. They call you in; youve got a Seinfeld episode they didnt like. You tell them OK we will change it.,

 When we were doing Seinfeld a lot of times they would come in and they would go we dont understand what you are doing. But go ahead. That was the way Seinfeld worked.,

 Why did it work?,

 It worked because there was a very loyal powerful audience out there that loved what we did no matterand no matter how crazy it was they stuck with us. And the networks they do watch that and they understand that. So even though they didnt get it they knew the audience got it and the audience liked it. So we were free. And thats the ultimate thing in this business when youre free to do whatever you want. Thats the ultimate.,

 You have attained that now?,

 I have. Well obviously. I dont need to be here. Im here because Im free to do whatever I want. ,

 So you actually chose to come here? I choose to come. I am no place that I dont want to be. What time do you wake up? What do you do in the morning? What do you do?,

 Do you really want to know? I have three kids.,

 Thats enough.,

 They are nine seven and five. If you have three kids it is like having a blender but you dont have the top. You wake up ready. You hit the ground ready. So I wake up and I have breakfast with the kids and we watch Elmo. And people say are you ever going to do another TV series? And I say to them I watch Elmo every morning and he jumps around and he tells jokes or she. I dont even know what the hell this thing is. And I watch Elmo every morning and I think you know what let him bust his little red ass.,

 Will the public get it though?,

 It is a comedy. I know comedy. He is smart.,

 Does you know Serbian empires?,

 No I dont know half of what he is talking about.,

 Why are we going to laugh?,

 Because we present it as a comedy. It is a comedy telling of the history of the world in 75 minutes. Is that clear Larry.,

 Yes. Did you write it all?,

 He wrote the whole thing.,

 And youre the director?,

 Im the director. Have you ever seen,

 Are you nervous.,

 This doesnt look like Broadway to you.,

 You could pitch this easy to people. Get out early.,

 We will get you the hell out of there. Yes. That is why people love this show.,

 You really like it if they look at their watch?,

 Yeah.,

 That means youre succeeding.,

 We apologize if it is 76 minutes.,

 No youre not. But November 9th,

 Wait a minute.,

 Helen Hayes Theater.,

 Do you know how rare it is? You know because you know a little bit about this business. We started in how many seats down there in 45 Bleaker? A hundred seatwe did 100-seat theater. Investors came in. They loved the show saidwe didnt want to take it to Broadway.We were just screwing around. And they go this is a Broadway show. We went really? They go yeah we will put up all the money.,

 You didnt put up any of your money.,

 No! Well,

 OK Jerry follow that.,

 Yes thanks Larry. Lets throw up the Zapruder film also.,

 But you like our heroes concept.,

 I do. I love the Heroes. Thats beautiful.,

 Its nice to salute everyday people.,

 That is the classiest thing on CNN. I love it. Dont you think? Thats really classic. Thats great. Thats great. No jokes.,

 Have you done heroic things ever?,

 What was this?,

 This is a heroic thing?,

 This is like a medevac. I come onyoure on a show here as a comedian with no audience. Thats you know,

 But theres people here.,

 Yeah I guess. But I would say to you whats funny about this show is theres no audience but you can still bomb. You can still go right down in jokes.,

 Whens your next in-person appearance?,

 Im in Memphis tomorrow night Friday.,

 Memphis.,

 Memphis Tennessee. Yes the good people of Memphis.,

 Theater. Big theater?,

 Its a little tiny theater. Of course its a big theater. Its a huge theater. I dont know what it is.,

 Do youtruly do you ever bomb any more? Are you too big to bomb?,

 No ones too big to bomb. No ones too big to bomb. So you dont automatically haveyou have them for the firstBob Hope said you have them for the first minute. You get a free minute because if you haveif youre well known. But afternobodyas I like to say nobody laughs at a reputation. If youre funny that night they laugh. If youre not they dont. They want to say I went to see this guy. He bombed. Theyre dying to tell that story.,

 How self confident you are.,

 Yes.,

 Well be back with our remaining moments with Seinfeld. Hes in Memphis. Dont bother theyre sold out Im sure.,

 Sold out. Double Delicious October 26th.,

 Wish we had more time Jer. When we did the scene in the bee movie you pulled up in one of the wildest looking cars.,

 Oh really?,

 Youre a car freak.,

 Im a total car nut yes.,

 How many cars do you own?,

 More than I need.,

 Why? You only need one to get somewhere. Why?,

 Because when youre in a car youre inside and youre outside. And youre moving and youre still all at the same time.,

 Youre moving and youre still.,

 Youre moving and youre still and youre inside and youre outside.,

 So why do you need four of them or five of them?,

 Because II love that experience of,

 Whats your favorite car?,

 My favorite car is a Porsche 73 RS that only a Porsche fanatic would know. ,

 What does it do that other carsIt makes certain sounds. It has a certain feel to it. Its just a hobby. Its an interest. Are you a fast driver?,

 No I drive reasonably,

 You live in the city of New York?,

 I live in New York City yes.,

 You drive around New York City?,

 Not around. No I leave. I go outside the city and I drive.,

 I dont know why thatsyou have space to park all these cars?,

 I have a little garage I keep my cars. I keep most of the cars someplace else. Im not telling the thieves where they are.,

 You lived in L.A. for a while didnt you?,

 I lived in L.A. for 18 years from 1980 until the end of the show in 1998. Then I came right back to New York because I believe New York makes you funny. And L.A. makes you less funny.,

 Why? Why would a city,

 Some cities are funny. Do you ever watch the local news in New York and they interview a garbage man? Hes always funny right?,

 Thats right. Not funny in L.A.?,

 Not funny. Garbage men arent funny in L.A.,

 Whats another funny city?,

 Minneapolis is funny. Miami is funny. Wouldnt you agree? Miami is funny. Tijuana is funny.,

 Is New Haven funny?,

 New Haven is not funny.,

 Toronto.,

 Funny.,

 Montreal?,

 Less funny,

 Youve got to be so hip to get this the band dont get it. Do you have any goals left? Youve got a Broadway show books.,

 I wasnt kidding you. I love these people I brought on the show tonight Barry Marder Colin Quinn. I love these people. I think theyre great talents. And that is my goal that the public should connect with this talent that hasnt quite been discovered yet. So thats my goal for Barry and for Colin.

 And you will succeed because youre a good guy and youre a funny guy.,

 Thank you Larry. And youre a great man. And we thank you for all your years of service.,

 And thanks for the clock. It shall be here nightly.,

 That really makes me feel good.,

 The cast of Saturday Night Live is here tomorrow night.,

 Where?,

 In New York.,

 That was my gag in the bee. Hes always telling you about some other show. Tomorrow night.,

It is a delight to welcome back to larry king LIVEa return visitnow she is the first of the United States Michelle Obama. The last time she waswell you werent even a candidate. You were,

 I wasnt. I was just hanging out and...,

 How do youdo you like the job?,

 I really do. Im enjoying myself.,

 Its not paid.,

 Itit isnt but its paid in so many ways other than money. You know II get to do whatyou know we talked about this when I was here before. When you like people having a job where you get to interact with folks on a day-to-day basis and you get to do things that make a differenceand you know I still control my own schedule toto some extent. So its not a bad gig.,

 All right. Whatthisthe childhood obesity thing whywhy is this your priority?,

 Yes well you know in the first year II focused on a number of things that I will continue to focus onsupport for military spouses; national service which is something Ive alreadyalways cared about. But as you know this year I planted this wonderful garden...,

 Yes.,

the first ever White House garden. And that was to begin the conversation about nutrition. And we engaged local kids in the D.C. area in that effort and got a feel for how they react a more substantive conversation.But on a personal note you know I come to this issue asas a mother. You know before coming to the White House especially when my husband was on the campaign trail we were living the lives of average familiesway too busy rushing...,

 Fast food.,

 Fast food you know deserts too much probably not monitoring TV. I was fortunate enough to have a pediatrician who worked in an urban environment in the African-American community. And he was tracking BMI. And he saw a little up tick in the kids BMI and he kind of pulled me aside.,

 BMI means?,

 Body mass index which is you know a measure of sort of where people fall onon the weight scale. Its one of the first indicators of...,

 And it was getting alarming?,

 It was getting to the point where he raised a red flag. And he probably was more cautious thanthan most people because of what he had been seeing in his own practice.,

 How did you react?,

 You know I was shocked at first because I didntI thought I was doing what I was supposed to do. And I hadnt noticed any changes in mymy kids. So it was a little bit shocking and a little disorienting because II wasnt sure what to do. But I went home and it was kind of a wake-up call. And we made some changes even with busy schedules. And they were minor changes but I thought well we have to do something so.,

 But did the kids go for it?,

 You know they did. And that was the...,

 They went to broccoli from French fries?,

 You know becausewell it was portion sizes. It was a few more cooked meals. You know we had no absolutes except no deserts during the week. Tooktook sugary drinks out of the lunchlunch boxes and put in water and had more milk had more fresh squeezed juices things like that. We talked about processed foods andyou know so they caught on pretty quickly once you know they understood the point of it all. And they became stricter monitors in our household than either me or their father so.,

 You put the kids in the army.,

 Theright. Thats right.,

 How do you reactthere were some who criticize not many but some who criticized you for personalizing itdiscussing it about your children.,

 Ithats the only way I can describe it because thats how I relate to it. And I know that if struggled with it in that way you know a person with means and information and access to you know everything that I needed then what on earth is going on in families and communities around the nation where people dont have the information? So I thoughtI thought it was important to share not just my story but the success. And the point is that small changes made a difference. It wasnt a whole scale upheaval of our lives to see the outcomes.,

 I dont want to get too statistical at the beginning tonight. Were going to cover other bases.,

 Yes.,

 But according to a 2007 New England Journal of Medicine the number of overweight children ages 6 to 19 has tripled in the last 30 years40 years. Twenty-five million kids are considered obese or overweight. That is a crisis.,

 One in three kids. And its one in two for the African- American and Hispanic community.,

 Does that lead then to adult diabetes heart trouble?,

 Well were already seeingyou talk to the American Academy of Pediatrics because theyre on board with this initiative. And theyre seeing high cholesterol in young kids high blood pressure asthma that is preventable...,

 Asthma?,

and Type 2 Diabetes which is the most sort of troubling because Type 2 Diabetes was only an adult disease and now itsits becoming more prevalent among kids. So you know one thing that II try to emphasize is that this isnt about weight and its not about looks. Its notits not a physical issue. Its really about the quality of life of our kids. Because you know teachers are seeing you know the challenges that kids with weight issues are havingnot being able to participate in gym feeling a little more sluggish. This is a quality of life issue. And its not about weight and diet. Its about fitness and its about overall nutrition that we really have to be emphasizing here.,

 Do you really think you can make a headway?,

 You know...,

 Youve got a task force formed today right?,

 Absolutely. The president signed the first ever federal memorandum that establishes a federal task force on childhood obesity. So do I think I can make some inroads?,

 Yes.,

 I think that working with the rest of the country with parents and business leaders and industry leaders and entertainment and sports leagues and parents and doctors and everyone yes I think that we cancan make a difference.,

 Now how do you handle itkids dont want to be told youre overweight.,

 Thats right.,

 Certainly you dont want to say youre fat.,

 Right. Thats right.,

 Isnt this is delicate?,

 Its an..., 

 This is a delicate balance.,

 Its an absoluteIwith my kidsagain all II have is my storyis I never talked about weight. I never discussed what the doctor said. I said you know what we need to change how we eat and lets think of some ways we can do it. So you can have these conversations without having the conversation. And I think its very important that we dont unintentionally make kids more paranoid or more self-conscious. At the same time I think that its not useful to point fingers at anyone at kids or parents.,

 Do you still drop into Burger King or McDonalds?,

 We dont do as much fast food but Iwe eat burgers and fries whenwhen...,

 You cant eliminate it though.,

 And you dont have to. I mean thats really the point here. Its really balance. What I tell my kids is if theyre eating right you know 70 percent of the time then when they go to a birthday party or its a Saturday and theyre out and you know they can stop for ice cream and somebody wants to grab pizza or they have pancakes with chocolate chips in it its not a big deal. Because thats how kids live.,

 Of course.,

and thats how you know theythey wouldnt go for it if it were absolutes. And I think thats one of the messages for parents.,

 But not daily.,

 Notwell notyou know not daily and not every meal every day you know?,

 We have an iReport question for you...,

 Yes.,

 How can a healthy five component lunch be provided for just $0.90 food cost? How can we make childrens health a true priority with the funding to back it up?.,

 Well thats one of the components of the Lets Move initiative which is the nationwide initiative that we kicked off today. Weve got to provide parents with the information and the tools that they need to make better decisions. But we also need to significantly change the quality of food that kids are getting at school because more than 30 million kids get half of their daily calories from the foods that they eat in school. And we dont want to set up a situation where weve got parents doing all the right things at home and then all that stuff gets undone. So the Child Nutrition Reauthorization Act isisis inin line for discussion this year. Were proposing a $10 billion increasethats $1 billion a year for 10 yearsto really implement this legislation. And we need to focus on the quality of schools in the lunches. I mean its one thing when you pack your own lunch. But so many families rely on what theyre being served in schools that...,

 You would think schools would be hip to things that...,

 Yes. Well and many are. Thethe Department of Agriculture has an initiative called the U.S. Healthy Schools Challenge where it recognizes schools that are already makings these differences. And there...,

 What do you...,

are hundreds of them. ,

 I want to touch some other bases then come back to this.,

 Sure.,

 The loss of Ted Kennedy.,

 Um-hmm.,

 You went to the funeral didnt you?,

 Oh yes. Yes.,

 And then the loss of the Senate seat. How has that affected your husband? And do you think this whole question ofof the health bill...,

 Well we were all saddened by the loss ofof Senator Kennedy. He was the consummate statesman. He was the grandfather of so much important legislation. And attending the funeral reminded us just the extent of thethe impact that hes had on the lives of all of us not just here in this country but around the world. So it was aa deep loss. But you know wewe have an opportunity to continue that legacy andand we have to.,

 Do you think you will? Do you think youll get a health bill?,

 I think we dont have a choice. When we look at these statistics were spending billions of dollars on preventable diseases. And new health care legislation could go a long way to improving prevention first and foremost. Health care reformpeople have to have a pediatrician in order to get good information from their pediatricians. People have to be able to take their kids to well doctors visits to have all this information tracked. So we have to get this done. And Im hopeful that Congress will come together that the American people will recognize that doing nothing is absolutely not an option and that well fulfill this legacy. So we have to stay vigilant. We need to get something done.,

 Does he get down easy your husband?,

 You know he doesnt get down easily. He gets very focused and very serious when hewhen hes facing a challenge. But you know the thing about Barak is that he stays humble and keeps things in perspective. I mean the challenges that he faces or has faced over this year are not what irk him. Itsits really you know our inability to solve basic fundamental problems facing the American people.improving the jobless rate getting people back to work ensuring that our kids are getting the absolute best education in the world that prepares them for the future that we have health care that were really pushing to fix our environment so that we have aa world to live in. When he doesnt get those problems solved thats what irks him.,

 More with the first lady of the United States. You like hearing that huh?,

 Its OK.,

 OK. Its obvious that we dont have to elaborate. Whats your read on the former governor of Alaska?,

 You know Iyou know I dont have a read. I mean I try not to make oror set opinions about people that I havent had any you know substantive interaction with. I mean I know what you see on TV and when youre in the...,

 Does it irk you when she criticizes what,

 You know democracy is about critique and the president is not immune to criticism. I think hes doing a phenomenal job. You know we have to think of where we were when he took office. We were on the brinkthe brink of a depression worse than anyone really ever imagined. And I dont think the country ever really knew how bad things were. And because of some important steps quick thinking smart strategic thinking were not even talking about that. Weve got to do more on jobs. We need to get health care done. Theres a lot of work to beto be done. Andand we need to do more to improve the civility in Washington. And I think ifif theres a disappointment Barack wishes that we hadwed comeor that wed come farther in thatin that effort.,

 Is sheis she a phenomenon to you?,

 Again I mean I think sheI think its wonderful to have strong female voices out there but I dont know her.,

 What did you think of the Tea Party?,

 You know ImIm focused on whats in front of me. And right now thats ending childhood obesity in a generationgetting this done. And I think when youre staying focused on solutions trying to bring folks togethergovernors mayors and doctors and educators and athletes together around an issue that has no political party you know has no base in liberalism or conservatism but its about our kids and making sure they have the best life possible then you know Iits hard for me...,

 But you have to think about other things. You read the papers you watch the television. YouI mean youre allyoure very smart and very aware.,

 Im very smart but II try to limit my intake to things that I can control. Because in this position you know it is my responsibility to work with all Americans. And I want to stay focused on the work...,

 Right.,

rather than you know.,

 Other things.,

 Other things.,

 Does he counsel with you?,

 We talk all the time. I mean we talk as weve done our entire marriage. But its more everyday talk. Itsitsyou know I try to make our home sort of a stress-free work-free zone for him because its necessary. When he works above the store its important tothat when he or I or our kids walk in the door of the residence that theres you know theres a release. So our attention and conversation is still focused mainly around our girls and our family our plans for the future. We do talk about health care. I want to know how his day is going. ImIm a citizen concerned about this country too so you know checking thethe temperature is important for me. We talked about this initiative and you know thats one of the reasons why he signed this memorandum because he knows the importance of tackling the childhood obesity...,

 But you also have to think how does Haiti strike you? What about these 100 Americansthese 10 Americans that may have taken children? We dont know of course what the answer is.,

 Right. Right.,

 Do you expect America to be involved in this?,

 Well I think that first of all the crisis in Haiti isyou know its devastating. For a country that poorfor any country for that matter to experience an earthquake of that magnitude its going to take decades for them to recover. With regard to kids the kids there I think that you know as the State Department and the U.N. Has said and expert agencies on the ground have said you know we want to make sure that we keep families together. And in a crisis like that kids get separated. Families wind up putting their kids in orphanages with the thought that its temporary until they can get back on thistheir feet. And one of the things that we dont want to do is unintentionally separate families fromfrom their kids. None of us wants that. So I think you know asas folks here said you know weve got to take it slow get the kids out who we know have homes to go to and make sure that were very careful about getting the kids who we dont have clear status on out.,

 Are you satisfied that Haiti will handle this well?,

 I think Haiti along with the non-profit organizations on the groundthe folks who you know do thisI think right now the Haitian government needs support fromfrom all sectors. Theretherethere will come a point when theyll get settled and you know things will start building and theyll be able to tackle everything. But right now Haiti needs our help on all these issues.,

 Were back with Michelle Obama the first lady of the United States. Dodo poll numbers bother you? I mean youre in that interesting influx of yours are up and your husbands are down.,

 Um-hmm.,

 Does that affect dinner?,

 No. No. No it doesnt.,

 That was funny?,

 Yes. That was goodit was a good one. No I mean itsits you know when youve been on this path in a campaign I mean you see how poll numbers they go up they go down. And sometimes you can pinpoint why sometimes you cant. I amImIm very flattered that the American people today feel like Im doing a very good job in representing them. And my husband is proud of that as well. So it doesnt cause any tension at the dinner table.,

 Just looking at him and observing him over these few years does he ever get mad mad?,

 Oh yes.,

 Angry angry?,

 Oh absolutely. But...,

 Ticked off?,

 Oh yes. Yes hes human. You know if you prick him hell bleed.,

 He never shows it.,

 You know I think that his view of mainmaintaining a constructive approachyou know hes always about finding the solution. And he knows if you go too far emotionally if you get too angry or youif you become too complacent sometimes you miss the answer in between. And thats I think one of the strengths of him as a leader. You know wewe talked about wanting a stable consistent leader. We have that in him. That doesnt mean he doesnt show emotion. Its just that he shows it at appropriate times. Hell come home. Hell talk to his cabinet. Hell you know hell converse with his advisers. There are appropriate times to show anger and frustration. But the American people dont care about the presidents anger or frustration. They want tothey want to know hes solving some problems.,

 We know how important fatherhood is to him motherhood is to you. I remember him telling me taking the kids to school was a big priority to him.,

 Yes.,

 He hated campaigning when he had to be away from it. He cant take them to school now right?,

 Yes well its a big old hassle.,

 So raising kids in the White House is hard right?,

 Its different. But its easier in so many ways...,

 How does he deal with that?,

 Well you know there are some things he cant do but there are many things he can do. He gets up every morning. He sees his kids before they leavenot something he did two years ago could do two three years ago. He comes home at a certain time. He can have dinner. He can read to the kids at night tuck them into bed. We have much more quality time. We cant go out necessarily but he still goes to the parent-teacher conferences. He still goes to the...,

 He goes to the school?,

 Oh absolutely. He goes to every performance and play. He goes to basketball games and soccer games. He cant go to every single one of them because someon Saturdays oftentimes hes working. But you know he is as involved as he has been its just for example he cant take the kids to school every day. Quite frankly they dont want him to. They think his motorcade is a complete embarrassment.,

 Whats it like for them growing up? Thatsone of the Roosevelt kids told me years ago that itsits at best its strange to grow up in that house.,

 Yes. It is. But you know I think you know what you know. And you know Ill be interested to see what they say when theyre 20 and 30. But right now theythey take it in stride. I mean the White House is a strange place to live but its surprisingly pleasant because the people who work there really care about every single family that comes through. Theyre good with kids and they try to adapt to their idiosyncrasies and create a sense of normalcy. So thats what they feel. Its like living in a big hotel with a whole bunch of fun people that you can work with. But then whenwhen the doors close itsits like home.,

 Do they have play dates?,

 They have play dates. They just...,

 Kids come over?,

 A friend just left the house because its a snow day. Were all snowed in so theyre getting stir crazy and driving us nuts. Had kidssome friends sleep over the night before last. They go over to other kids homes. They do...,

 They do that thats a problem for the Secret Service isnt it when they go to other peoples ,

 The Secret Service is very accommodating. And we donttry not to talk too much about what they do but you know the kids do ,

 But you tell them theyre going over to Henrys house?,

 The kids lead normal lives. And its because of the Secret Service that they can.,

 Good for you.,

 Yes.,

 Were back with Michelle Obama. By the way tomorrow night the vice president of the United States Joe Biden will be here. And still to come some moments tonight with Bill Cosby. Not bad so far.,

 One of my favorite favorite people.,

 Both of them right?,

 Oh absolutely. The ,

 Dont leave Jo out.,

 Jo and Bill absolutely.,

 All right probably the biggest single problemhyphenated with health careis jobs right?,

 Um-hmm.,

 You mentioned it briefly. Theres so many people out of work. His critics say your husband should be doing more he promised more.,

 Um-hmm.,

 How do you react?,

 Yes. Until the unemployment numbers go down I dont think my husband is satisfied. And more isis coming. You know a lot was saved with the stimulus. And again you know itsits hard to tell people who are hurting that things could have been worse if we hadnt done what weve done. So you know theres no point in pointing back. Theres a lot more to be done and hes not going to be satisfied and hesuntil he sees those unemployment figures go down.,

 How is theit was so bitterwell rather bitter in the campaign with Hillary when they were going at each other.,

 Yes it seems so long ago.,

 Yes. How are they doing now together?,

 Theyre great. Hillary Clinton is an amazing secretary of State. I mean she would have been an amazing president. She was an amazing attorney. Shes a phenomenal professional. And shes proven to be a tremendous asset inin so many ways. So the relationship isisis strong. They share the same views in terms of international policy and approach. And were seeing the outcome of that on the international stage. I think you know we can say pretty clearly that the United Statesthethe view of this nation around the world has changed. People are enthusiastic about the potential. Things arent perfect. Were still a nation fighting two wars. But when we travel around the country the excitement and the possibility are palpable. And I think thats because of the president but I think its also because of our secretary of State.,

 How tough is it for you when a man or a woman is lost in battle?,

 Oh its the hardest thing. You know I think one of the hardest things that the president said he had to do this year was to greet the caskets of fallen soldiers that evening to you know sit down with parents who have buried their child. When we went to Fort Hood you know meeting with the families ,

 Oh.,

of the survivors ofof that tragedy I mean you know ,

 How do you train for that?,

 You dont you know? What helps me is that II see how strong they are. You know just how ,

 They help you?,

 They help me. Thatsyou know thats one of thethe reasons why the issue of military families is so important to me. Maybe its selfish because they give me strength. You know and the same thing is true for the president. When we look around and you think of the minor irritations that go along with being the president you think about the real sacrifice ofof our troops and you want to make sure that they have the resources they need when theyre in the battlefield and that they have the resources and support when they come home and that their families are well taken care of. And we have to work hard for that. Thats you know thats not just a given.,

 Some more moments with the first lady her highnessah Well we got rid of that years ago right?,

 Yes. Yes.,

 Were back with Michelle Obama. Fighting obesityhow about the image problem of children?,

 Um-hmm.,

 They have a certain self-image. This could hurt them to hear things like this couldnt it? Again weve discussed delicate balance.,

 Right. Right. And I get,

 We tread water here.,

 Well youand you have to continue to tread water. Approaching this we have to look at it from a whole range ofof pillars as weinformation to parents improving school lunches improving accessibility and affordability which means eliminating food deserts. Areas in this country where there are no supermarkets so that families do have access to food. And then the last important pillar is really physical education. And that seems to be one of the more important ones for me. Because if kids are able to raise their level of activity it frees them up to not have to worry about you know every little thing that they eat because their activity level tends to be that of a normal kid. The presidents fitness challenge is going to play an important role really modernizing that challenge to make sure that it just doesnt focus on athleticism. Which it has in the pasthow many push ups or sit ups you can do. And not every kid is an athlete. But you dont have to be an athlete to be physically fit. You just have to move.,

 What are you asking Joe and Martha Citizen to do? ,

 Well ,

 A couple is watching tonight. They got two kids at home. What do you ask them to do?,

 Yes. Im sayfirst of all be cognizant. You know be honest. Look around and say you know Are things where they should be? You know? Are my kids good? Are they getting the level of physical activity? Are they eating right? Do they have the energy level? If the answers are no talk to your pediatrician. Get a real assessment of whats going on. And then work with them to structure some solutions. And they can be pretty small you know? Id say turn off the T.V. Eat dinner together as a family. There was a study that showed that structure in childrens lives whether theyre eating meals as a family on a regular basis they have a regular bed timeall that structure really decreases thethe likelihood that a child will be obese.,

 You can make changes.,

 Cut down portion sizes. And even if youre not in a safe neighborhood find ways to be more active with your kids. And it could be turning on the radio and dancing until you sweat for a half an hour. If you live on the top floor walk up and down the stairs. Walk to school if you can.,

 Yes.,

 Find those small ways as a family to ,

 Simple.,

 Yes. You know and thats what I would tell the average viewersimple.,

 Yes.,

 You know its not a whole scale change. Small changes.,

go to quick things.,

 Yes.,

 Just a few days till Valentines.,

 Yes.,

 What do you expect? Roses? Chocolates?,

 Oh I expect the moon the stars and the sun honey.,

 What do you usually get?,

 I usually get dinner and a gift of some sort.,

 Then youre going to go out for Valentines?,

 I dont know.,

 Its a Sunday.,

 I dont know. Because we might be traveling. We might spend some time at Camp David. So ifbut Im not sure yet. We havent finalized the plans.,

 Does he get a gift federally?,

 A nice card.,

 Thanks.,

 Thank you.,

 Tonight Jimmy Fallon. The late night laugh man is turning primetime Emmy host. He wants your help. Well find out why. And then his take on the new cast of Dancing with the Stars his old stomping ground Saturday Night Live. Plus Jay versus Dave versus Conan. Whats it like to play beer pong with Betty White? Jimmy Fallon keeping it real even when he imitates other people. Hes next on larry king LIVE. I love our openings. Thank you folks. Good night. Were out of time. Jimmy Fallon is here. Hes host of the double-award Emmy winning Late Night with Jimmy Fallon. Hes hosting the 62nd annual primetime Emmy Awards this Sunday night on NBC.,

 By the way dont make that be confusing because its not the 60 second annual primetimeits longer than 60 seconds. I dont want people thinking that its 60 seconds only,

 I meant the annual I meant the show is 62nd years.,

 Its longer than 60 seconds.,

 Okay.,

 A lot of people have been asking me about that. It will be longer than a minute.,

 And I have in front of me an Emmy I won.,

 Hey.,

 Yes. So I thought it would be appropriate that we display this in your honor.,

 Thats a beautiful award.,

 Yes well you have gotten them.,

 You have probably many awards. Yes I just got one recently but I think they mail them to you. I havent got mine Fed Exd to me yet. But thats a beautiful,

 How did they ask you to host this? Howd that come about? ,

 Well its on NBC this year. So I think they run down their NBC list of like whoso I was right under The Biggest Loser. And then it was me. And they goBiggest Loser said no. And I said yeah absolutely. But I did the Emmys last year actually. Neil Patrick Harris did a great job hosting. And I did,

 You were a presenter?,

 I was a presenter. And I did some bit where I came out with auto tune mike. So he sounded like it was rapper T-Pain. So I came on and I was like party everybody ready to party. And I slipped and I fell and I pretended to hurt my back. And then I was just screaming in pain but auto tuned. So it was likehelp me. And so I did that for a while. And then I said just roll the clip. Roll the clip. And then so asked me they said would you want to host? Maybe think about it for next year.,

 I mean who in your family knocked the crib over?,

 Hey we didnt have a crib. I was raised by wolves.,

 A take-off on the Mad Men. Funny funny.,

 Yeah yeah.,

 The preparation for this kind of show what do you have to go through? Like youre on tape all this week right?,

 Yeah. Im on repeats all this week in New York. So Im out in L.A. I got a tan. Well this is what I call a tan. This is pretty good for an Irishman. I burn first. And then it takesthe burn goes away and they turn like a cinnamon colored but I come out here. As soon as I heard that I was hosting we started writing. I worked with my writers on Late Night. And we came up with like 200 great ideas. And then you know honestly probably 50 ideas. And then the producer we gave it to the producer. He goes these are all great. Tom (INAUDIBLE) is a great producer. He goes these are all great. He goes but we do have to give out awards at sometime. So we cant dothis is too many bits. We cant. So we whittled it down. We have a really good opening a strong opening I think. And then,

 Thats the key to those shows that opening though?,

 It is right.,

 You got to grab them.,

 You got to have a good opening.,

 Can you give us a hint?,

 I cant give you a hint. Its,

 Just a hint.,

 a lot of celebrities are helping me in the opening.,

 Oh. Theyve rehearsed it and all with you?,

 Uh-huh uh-huh.,

 Are they going to tape the opening or you do it live?,

 You asked for one hint Larry.,

 Okay.,

 This is sane. This is getting ridiculous.,

 Youre having a Twitter contest regarding the Emmys. Explain it for our fans.,

 Okay. So what were going to do. What youre going to do is youre watching the Emmys. And you have your computer your laptop next to you your mobile phone. You look at the presenters that are on that list. And you go Jon Hamm. And you go my grandma should leave my grandpa for Jon Hamm. And you Tweet that out. And then I get it. And I select from the differentall amounts of Tweets. And I could use your tweets to intro a presenter Jon Hamm on the Emmys. So and you could type out any intro you want as many times as you want.,

 Do I get something if you use my Twit?,

 Fame.,

 Your name?,

 Fame yes.,

 Fame?,

 Yes your name is on the Emmys. And your Twitter address. So youll probably get followers. I guarantee at least five followers. Yeah.,

 This bizarrebut this is modernthis is social media right? ,

 I figured this isyes I mean thisyou couldnt do this last year. I figure this is just somethingwho knows if itll work? It might now work but its something different. And its something to keep you watching the Emmys. Youre like well why not? Im here. I got my phone with me. I might as well try it.,

 This is only Thursday but being honest are you nervous?,

 Yes a little nervous.,

 Its a big platform.,

 Ive thrown up a couple of times. More for weight loss but you know you know because you lose weight faster if you throw up your food.,

 And you know the critics watch this and on Monday morning you get reviewed..,

 Yes I know that. And its usually the reviews are never that good. They never,

 They dont laugh. Critics dont laugh.,

 They yes. So Im not really looking for good critics. I was thinking about that because Neil Patrick Harris did pretty well last year. So I was going to do what he did word for word. I figured if I do half as good as he did Ill be happy.,

 You won a couple Emmys this week right?,

 Yes.,

 Oh yes,

 Who won?,

 You won this week on the,

 Oh I did? I won one for editing because we do these pretapes. We spoof Real Housewives. We spoofed Lost. We did a series called Late where an elevator crashes on the floor and we didnt know how to get off. We have no budget on our show Larry. You have to understand. We have to use an abandoned floor at NBC. And we made it work. So we got nominated yes. And so we won for a Glee spoof we did called 6-B because thats where our studio is. And so like we did like a sing thing a song thing. And it was really funny. And then we also won for best website. Latenightwithjimmyfallon.com.,

 Website is now an Emmy?,

 Yes of course. What are you talking about? Its always been.,

 When , 

 I dontno I mean I dont know if its a newIll take it. Its an Emmy.,

 Did you jump up and shriek with glory and glee?,

 Yes I cried yes I cried. And thats just what happens in my bedroom every night. I justI have problems. I got to take an Ambien or something because its justthese nightmares I have are just awful. I could get into detail with you but it would justit would blow your mind.,

 Do you want to keep doing this late night thing forever? Do you have a goal beyond this like,

 Good question.,

 Leno out you in?,

 No. Well Im happy where I am. At 12:30 its like if you get you know the viewers the ratings theyre happy. The networks happy. Im happy. So so far so good. So Im really happy,

 You dont look beyond it?,

 No. I said this on the show and the whole late night thing went down I said the one thing Ive learned from hosting late night from David Letterman and from Conan OBrien is that its a one way ticket to not hosting The Tonight Show. If you want to not host The Tonight Show host late night for a couple of years. See what happens.,

 Thats right. Youre doomed.,

 Yes exactly. Yes so maybe Ill get into like the perfume business.,

 Now theres a rumor spreading here that younow youre a big shot host.,

 Yes.,

 Are you thinking of getting this job? And want to check this out were you sitting in this chair earlier?,

 Was I sitting in that chair?,

 Yes did you sit in this chair my chair?,

 I dontI dont think so. I mean I dont know what youre talking about?,

 No are you denying it?,

 I dont know what youre getting at Larry.,

 Were you comfortable in this chair?,

 It was a very comfortable chair actually. It really is.,

 It is nice isnt it?,

 Its worked in yes. Has that been here for the whole time?,

 Well you lied to me though.,

 Now its turning into the godfather. Are you going to put an orange peel in your mouth and,

 You have relatives in New Jersey? Jimmy got his start on Saturday Night Live. Well take a look at some of his greatest moments and ask what he thinks of that show now and whats ahead for that show. And well talk of course about late night wars. Dont go away. Okay. Jimmy Fallon he hosts Late Night. Now youve got your show.,

 Yes.,

 Because Conan was replacing Jay.,

 Yes.,

 So they need someone at 12:30.,

 Thats right.,

 And then do you feel any guilt that you suddenly have a show that Conan didnt have until he signed with TBS and Conan mentioned you that he wouldnt quit because they were going tohe wouldnt stay because they were going to move you to 1:00 a.m.,

 Yes.,

 So you changed the face of late-night television. Do you think about that? Think about it.,

 You put it that way Im thinking about it yes.,

 You!,

 Yes thank you yes. I got it. Yes. Iyou know what?,

 Were live now Jimmy.,

 I actually got thisI know well when I got thiswhen I got Late Night everything was fine. I was doing Late Night its good. Conan was there. And Jay wasJay we didnt know what Jay was up to.,

 Somewhere at 10:00. ,

 Yes Jay ended up at 10:00 but we didnt know what he was going to do at 10:00. Then he 10:00. And then it became like the biggest story in the business. And Im just sitting there like I just got here. Like I dont knowand I got here at the most exciting time in late night. And Im friends with Jay. And Im friends with Conan. And Im friends with Dave. I mean Im friends with all those guys because as an actor you go on all the shows. So I know all of them. So I was like Im just going to keep doing my job and keep my head down and just try to make people laugh.,

 What did you make of the wars?,

 You know its tricky. Its difficult stuff. And you go like I dont knowI dont know what the real story is. I dont know what theyve dealt with but I know that itsit was crazy.,

 What was NBC thinking your network,

 Yes.,

 about a 10:00 script show?,

 Another talk show. Well I thought you do Jay Lenos talk show. Then you do the news. Then you do Conans talk show. And I think at that point everyone in Americas just ready for one more talk show.,

 That was the thinking.,

 Yesthattheyre just primed up. Like lets go. More talk. This is fantastic.,

 All right how do you think Conans going to do at 11:00 on TBS?.,

 I think TBSTBS is very lucky to have Conan OBrien I think. I think hes a funny funny guy. I know him. Hes great. So I think itshes going to change the face of their late night structure absolutely because,

 You ever get to see Craig Ferguson?,

 Yes I talked to him on the phone.,

 You do?,

 Yes.,

 Hes a funny guy too.,

 Hes a really funny guy. Hes a charming guy a smart guy. We have totally two different shows which I love because I love being up against that because its like,

 Yes night,

 You got this whole gig. You came to comic Saturday Night Live.,

 Yes.,

 Did youwere you comfortable in the fact of hosting a show interviewing people doing bits?,

 Not at first. Its not easy. Its tricky. I mean I got used to it. I mean when I first started I didnt have the air conditioning where it should be in my studio. I was sweating flops sweat (INAUDIBLE) Deniro cross-eyed. Like so what are you like raging bull? Youre in a movie? Hows the movie? Whats a movie? Go to commercial. Like whats a movie? Like he was confused. And now Im much better.,

 Yes almost like a Weekend at Bernies thing. Were attaching the strings to her arms. Were going to clap and stuff like that.,

 Well lets hope she lives. Okay? All right. How did youhow did you get Saturday Night Live? What were you doing at the time?,

 I was doing stand-up comedy out in Los Angeles out here. I got my start at the Improv on Melrose Bud Friedman (ph). When I was in New York I grew up in upstate New York. Socrates New York. My mom ,

 Socrates?,

 Socrates no Socrates that was my nickname.,

 Okay.,

 Socrates New York. Its by Woodstock Poughkeepsie. And my mom heard about an impression contest on the radio. And so she told me she goes youre doing voices up in your room. And so why dont you you know go after this contest? And I went out. It was at Bananas Comedy Club and I won first place. And I think it was like $500. I was 16 years old. And I was like $500 for one minute of comedy? This is my career.m

 Thats a good gig.,

 This is a good gig.,

 How did you get Saturday Night Live?,

 So I went out to L.A. I did Groundlings. And I justI took acting lessons. And I got an audition for the show. I went and performed in front of Lorne Michaels.,

 Just him sitting there?,

 Its a dark room.,

 What did they have you do?,

 They have you do impressions and the original characters and if you do any music do musical impressions. And I was an impressionist. I just wanted to do just different characters and voices. And everyone tells you Lornes not going to laugh. He wont laugh. So the guys putting the microphone on and hes like hey good luck dude. Lornes not going to laugh. What do you mean? He goes Mr. Michaels (INAUDIBE) so dont worry about it. If he doesnt laugh justits like okay no problem. So then I go into the make-up room. And the girls like oh you look great but Lornes not going to laugh. Just know that he doesnt laugh. Hes seen it all. And so I go okay okay thats great. And then I go into wardrobe. And he was like here you go. You look great. And Lorne doesnt like toI go no he doesnt like to laugh. I heard you. What is this guys problem? So anyways I go out. And I do this. Im so scared. Everyone tells me hes not going to laugh. And I do impressions. And at one point I do Adam Sandler. And he starts laughing. And he puts his head in his hand. And he starts laughing. No one had done Adam Sandler. And I was like wow. It was my moment. I go this is just the coolest thing.,

 Hire you right there?,

 No but I just felt it right there. Im like thats like my Wonder Years moment.,

 Well how did they get,

 No they makes you wait for like three months. This is true. They make you wait. Your agent is calling every day. You dont hear anything. Im like I didnt get it. Im a loser. This is over. You know my careers done. You know I dont know what to do. I was going to have eight babies with somebody and start a reality show. I didnt know what was going to happen. So then what I washe calls and I met him. And I was in California out in Paramount Studios. And I met him in a room that was all white. It was very heavenly. Its like cream colored and white. It was like a Calvin Klein obsession ad. And the wind was blowing. And he had his shirt off. No just kidding. But he was sitting there. And he had his feet up. And he goes do you wear wigs? This is the first question. I was like oh I do this to my hair. He goes no no. Im asking if youve ever done characters and wore wigs he goes because we want you for the show.,

 Wow.,

 And then everything was in slow motion.,

 Lets take a look at some of Jimmys greatest Saturday Night Live hits. Watch. What a lot of fun that was.,

 It was the best job in the whole wide world.,

 Ill bet.,

 It was the greatest and all the history there. And,

 How many years were you on?,

 Six seasons. So I think it was almost seven.,

 WhatI hear Will Fortes not returning next year?,

 Yes its a bummer.,

 Hes a movie star now right?,

 Yes I guess so. I dont know. I haven talked to him about why,

 So you became a star. A lot of stars came from that show.,

 I leftI wanted to do what Belushi did. He was in three years and left. But it justthings dont work like that anymore. Like do you know Chevy Chase was only on one season?,

 What? Who?,

 He was only on for one season Chevy Chase.,

 One year?,

 Thats it.,

 Falling down.,

 Falling down. Thats it. Big star movie star. I mean but everyone thinks Chevy Chase must have been on for ten seasons.,

 What do you make of the show now?,

 Its great. Its the best show on television besides larry king LIVE.,

 Because?,

 Because its live. Its live and to do all that,

 Risk taking?,

 Its all that work the hard work. Just the lighting is hard work. The makeup the hair the costume changes. I mean do you know how many times we spoof larry king LIVE on the show? Its not easy to build the little dots behind here.,

 One night you came on you know you breathe cold. You dont say anything. Its just coldthe first bit is always cold.,

 Yes.,

 And Im watching. I was at Disneyworld for an award show. I was a presenter to Ted Turner. He was going on television hall of fame. And it was Saturday night. And I turned on TV. And I see my set and Iand the first thing I said was theyre running a tape.,

 You thought did I do that?,

 Yes.,

 When did I do that?,

 They do great things.,

 They do great work. And its like live every week. And its like what people dont know going to commercial break you know youre at home watching a commercial but theyre running around. Theres people under the bleachers.,

 Now they show them running around.,

 Yes.,

 Then they do awhere they show,

 A quick little bumper.,

 Yes.,

 Its magical show. And Lorne Michaels is brilliant and all the people that work there brilliant.,

 Jimmys imitated some of the biggest names out there. Seinfeld Cosby and as you saw earlier even me. Well get a sampling of some of his voices next. Hes hosting the Emmys. Were back. What happened there?,

 Well you know what it is? Im wearing a hearta heart thing.,

 Oh.,

 So if I get too close to a microwave or a clip of my show things go screwy.,

 Im a huge huge fan of yours.,

 Thanks.,

 What I wanted to know is how hard is it to try to keep a straight face when youre working with these people that are obviously so talented?,

 I have the worst time at that. Thank you for asking. I really break up in sketches. Im very unprofessional actor. But Ive worked withwe did a sketch calledI think it was calledeveryone calls it Cow Bell now or I Need More Cow Bell. It was with Will Farrell and he was a cow bell player in the band. And he played it so loud that the band couldnt hear any of the instruments. They have the amplifiers and hes hitting this cow bell really loud. And then the producer comes in Christopher Walkenhe would come in and go what was wrong with that take? It was great. He goes I got to have more cow bell though. You know? So he kept doing this. Will Farrells like thats what Im trying to say. Thats what Im saying. We have to have more. And so he did this bit dress rehearsal and then on air he came on with a smaller shirt. And so when he lifted the cow bell his gut came out the bottom. I couldntthen the glasses fell off at one point. He was running around kicking things.,

 You had to laugh.,

 I couldntit was looking in the eyes of a lunatic. Hes the funniest man on Earth. It was fantastic.,

 Did you see the other guys? Three times I saw it. You cant stop laughing.,

when they had the silent fight at the funeral? Theyre whispering fighting like Im going to kill you. They start fighting each other but quietly.,

 Bed Bath and Beyond.,

 Oh my gosh. Great.,

 Mark Wahlberg.,

 He was fantastic. Michael Keaton they got his back.,

 Hey Jimmy. Whos your favorite person you ever worked with on Saturday Night Live?,

 I probably would say Lorne Michaels as far as people.,

 I guess she means in skits.,

 Id say theyre all good. Theyre all cast members. But me and Tina Fey had a good ride.,

 Shes doing OK.,

 What is she up to?,

 What is she doing?,

 I think shes doing a show with Kate Gosselin.,

 Do you have a fixation on Kate Gosselin? Do you have something for Kate Gosselin? Youve mentioned her three times already.,

 Look Im just saying if this show doesnt work out for me Kate I can dance. I can be a dancing partner. I have seen you dance.,

 I know you can dance.,

 Yeah.,

 OK. Lets do some imitations all right? We dont have to go long.,

My dad was verymy mom verytheyre performers in the house. They have house parties and were Irish so thats what Irish people do. They get together; they have a good time and then someone sings a sad song where you all cry and then go to sleep. Maybe theres a fight.,

 Thats in the other room.,

 Yeah in the bar. My dad would do like James Cagney and stuff like that. And I think I learned from my dad to do impressions. When I was a kid I would do like Rodney and James Cagney and those guys.,

 Yes. It was like all right. I cant do it right now by the way. I tell you right my wifes cookings so bad since when does toast have bones? OK? She said take out the garbage; I said you cooked it you take it out. All right? Hes the greatest.,

 He was funny.,

 Man No Respect was great. My dad had the No Respect album. They were very Irish Catholic raised kids. My dad would take a key and scratch out the curse words on the album so it would skip over the curse words. so Id miss half the joke. I tell you the guy walked in and he wasmy wife saidand then he saidand you go OK this isIm not getting this joke.,

 Is there any famous performer that you couldnt catch? A guy you couldnt imitate that you wanted to imitate? Is there an un- imitatable person? There must be some.,

Hes the guyhe calls his the ABS the Situation because theyre justhe calls it a situation when he shows people his abs. The new thing this season they cut to him any time something happens for a reaction shot. He is like Mr. Furley from Threes Company. like something happensSnookie drops a chicken hes likewhat?

Letterman has all the mothers famous mothers on the show to do the top ten lists. Every mother comes out and does a joke. Its like Beyonces mother Lance Armstrongs mother. So my mom comes out and her joke was like stay away from that Paris Hilton or something. It was a funny joke. And then she went back in line with all the other mothers. So Letterman is going by and hes giving a rose to all the mother that came on the show. Here you go. Thanks for coming on. Thanks for coming on. He goes up to my mother thanks for coming on. My mother goes what? And its likereally mom? He goes thanks for coming on. She goes oh OK. And he gives her another rose. He gets to his mother hes out of roses because he gave my mom two roses.

 Betty get over here.,

 What a pleasure to have as our special guest tonight on larry king live Sir Paul McCartney. If I have to tell you who he is we all have a major problem. His new book is Blackbird Singing: The Poems and Lyrics From 1965 to 1999. You dont normally do things like this...,

 What poetry?,

 ... lyrics and book poetry.,

 No.,

 Are you a poet?,

 Well I mean I tried when I was a kid to write some poetry but it got rejected from the school magazine so I became a songwriter to get my own back. Did OK at that.,

 Not bad.,

 And then what happened was a friend of mine died prematurely of Parkinsons in his early 30s and we were really close. He was the guy who introduced me to John Lennon and he was such a sweet guy. And his passing made me want to write a poem rather than write a song. I dont know why. And since then Ive sort of written poems.,

 Are theythe great Alan Jay Lerner told me that songwriting is not poetry. Its a different craft. Do you agree?,

 Yeah. I do agree. Yeah I was persuaded with this book to put lyrics in because the guy whos editing it said some of these lyrics are poems which is kind of the other way around. And I met Allen Ginsberg once the great American poet ...,

 I know him well. ,

 ... who he saidyou know him? He said that Eleanor Rigby is a hell of a poem. So I thought well you know he should know so I was kind of persuaded to do it. But I do think theyre different personally you know.,

 He called lyric writing a kind of a special craft.,

 Well if Id be talking to Allen about poetry hed correct me when it was kind of a poem. Oh I wouldnt listen to him of course but hed try and correct my poetry. But if it was a song hed say I wont try and touch that and he wouldnt dare get involved with the songs.,

 What is it like to be a Sir?,

 Its interesting. As my dad would have said is that spelled cur?,

 Do they dub you? Do they take a little sword and put it on you shoulder?,

 Yeah thats probably the best thing. You know what it is? Its like winning a grade school prize that you didnt go in for and they sort of suddenly say hes OK they give you this prize. And you go to the palace and her majesty the Queen of England youve got to kneel down on a little red stool for your knee which is good because my knee was giving me a bit of jip (ph) that day.So I kneeled down and she takes Edward the Confessors sword... Come on Larry. Voom-voom. I you know arise Sir Paul.,

 I dub thee...,

 Yeah.,

 ... Sir Paul.,

 Yeah.,

 And yet though when I said Do you want to be called Sir Paul you say no.,

 Well you know I mean I love the honor but my worry about accepting it was that people would now think I changed and I was like whoa. The guys on my farm said What do we call you now? You know it was like I said you call me sir lordship.,

 You are a sir. Before webefore we went on we were talking about growing up and I was talking about growing up in Brooklyn and you in Liverpool. But youyou never forget where youre from right?,

 I dont. Some people do.,

 You carry Liverpool with you.,

 Yeah I love it. I go back quite frequently. Ive got millions of family there.,

 Friends too?,

 Friends too but a lot of family which is breeding as we speak. I mean they just keep on going. They justand to them Im just our Paul.,

 Yeah so youre not sir...,

 Im not...,

 ... and youre not the Beatles and youre not the Wings. Youre...,

 I have a hard time impressing them. I said...,

 Is that good for you?,

 ... look well Im famous in the world. Yeah I love it. Of course I do.,

 What do you do when youre thisdo you pinch yourself saying how did all this happen to me? Do you...,

 Of course Larry.,

 Do you accept it? I mean...,

 Yeah.,

 Theres no one who doesnt know you. So whats life like?,

 Well you know its great. Lifes great because this is what I wanted to do. I wanted to achieve like you. You know youre out of Brooklyn. You wanted to you know to get famous and make money and all that stuff everyone wants to do. So I did that. So Im not ever going to try and say I didntI dont want to be here. But I think what I doI dont know if you do itbut I separate the famous me from like the private me. And Iwhich is fine. That works great because its sort of he that goes on stage and gets knighted and hes great you know. And then theres me that was like 5 years old and I remember it. And thats sort of the one I am. I think the awkward thing is I go in Central Park and Im being this one and they think Im that one.,

 Yeah thats the rub right?,

 Thats the rub.,

 And how do you deal with that?,

 Not very well. I dont like it at all. I said Cant you see Im being this one? Click click click click click. Story. Go away! and other words.,

 So youve paid the price. Its a price you pay for what you wanted.,

 Yeah its OK. Its all right. Its not too bad at all you know. Ive been aI can think of worse things.,

 Did you know early on when you were just the Beatles in little clubs you were good?,

 Yeah.,

 What did you know?,

 We were musical. John and I had a little thing that was a little spark of something. The other guys were great musicians. We were a great little unit. I think the thing that I always thought about us was that we were kind of a little bit more artsy than the others. So weyou know John went to art school. I studied literature at school and got a kind ofan A levelcalled an A level. So I did Chaucer and Shakespeare. So its a little bitslightly more artsy than the other guys in the other bands.,

 So you knew we can do what we do well?,

 Yeah and I thought we had an edge in that artsiness kind of like studenty and just a bit cool. So...,

 It kind of worked out.,

 Ityou know what? It was great.,

 Well be right back with Paulie. Is that OK?,

 Sure Larry.,

 Theres many stories about why they broke up. Why did...,

 The Beatles broke up?,

 Yeah. Why did you break up? The essence.,

 EssenceI think it was time. I always remember the old song Wedding bells are Breaking up That Old Gang of Mine you know. The Army buddies the band and youre going to grow up. Youre going to get married. Youre going to get girlfriends and have babies and things and you dont do that in a band. So I kind of think weif you look at it we really came full circle and...,

 Was it angry?,

 Yeah it got a bit bitter towards the end. We had a sort of strange manager guy who came in from New York and that got bitter. It got a bit of a feud thing going. So we started bitching at each other.,

 Did you...,

 And it was time.,

 ... did you record after you knew it was going to end? In other words was there anything...,

 Yes.,

 ... done after you knew this is it?,

 Yeah. There was a little bit of stuff. Yeah which wasnt bad stuff.,

 No?,

 Still good stuff because we were still good musically you know we just may be a little tense as friends now.,

 That had to be hard though then to go on stage together or no?,

 Not on stage recording. We werent on stage by that time.,

 When you got enormous what was that like? I mean to come to New York...,

 It was fantastic.,

 ... and I remember in Miami and a crowd...,

 It was fantastic. Yeah it was really cool.,

 What did you make of it though?,

 Well I mean we were kids who had looked at America as you know theyre a great country like a lot of the world does you know and youre British kids. Elvis Presley you know was from here or Motown all the black artists that we loved from here. Soand we dont have R&B radio stations like in England. You know its sort of Good morning and this is Elvis Presley singing his new new song. But here its like Yeah (UNINTELLIGIBLE) you know? And we just loved the radio stations. And it was just fantastic. We arrived. We were in America. We were huge. I think we made a really cool move thatI think George Harrison doesnt remember that we did it but I remember some time saying to Brian Epstein our manager we mustnt go to America until weve got a No. 1 record. A lot of British acts came here and were like second on the bill to people like Fabian. And in England they were like No. 1 and people were going thats not too cool you know. Second on the bill to Elvis maybe but not Fabian or Frankie Avalon...,

 So what was the song that brought to you here?,

 I Want To Hold Your Hand.,

 It was No. 1 and you came.,

 No. 1 so we came. So the press said Hey Beatles where you (UNINTELLIGIBLE)? We said were No. 1 man and theres no answering that you know.,

 You mentioned Presley. What was that meeting like?,

 It was great. I loved it. The thing is...,

 You met the guy.,

 ... it was so long agoyeah we met with him in Los Angeles.,

 And I hear not much was said initially., 

 Well...,

 True?,

 My memory was that it was really quite straightforward that we loved him. We were a little in awe of him.,

 Really?,

 Yeah. Well he washe was the man you know. Wed grown up with him. We were just kids. We were just a little bit younger and we were in awe. But the funny thing is when we got togetherme George and Ringofor the Beatles anthology got together to discuss it all we all had completely different memories. I said...,

 Of that meeting?,

 Of the meeting. Yeah which is terrible. We didnt have time...,

 I heard someone say that youhe was hesitant and then they talked about guitars.,

 Yeah basshe was trying to learn bass guitar and me being the base player I thought this is cool. Let me show you a couple of licks Elvis.,

 Hey Elvis.,

 No I said he came and met us at the door and Ringo sort of said no he never stood up all evening. So it wasyou know whos telling the truth. I am. But... But I remember him having the first remote control for a TV wed ever seen. You know...,

 Really?,

 Yeah...,

 Thats a great story.,

 And hes just going click click click. And were going oh its changing. It seems like ancient history now but it was very modern then.,

 The John Lennon death where were you?,

 I was in England. It was early morning when I heard.,

 Who told you?, 

 My manager rang me and Linda had just gone to drop the kids at school. It was that kind of time in the morning. So my manager just rang me and thats where I was.,

 And he said right out?,

 Yeah. He said You better sit down Ive got some really bad news. And then Linda came back and she said Whats wrong because she could just see I had just gone pale. Yeah that wasthat was some shock.,

 You had a strangewas strange a good word to describe the relationship you and Johnup and down...,

 Not really no. Towards the end when we had these business troubles it got strange but it wasnt strange otherwise. It was very close.,

 Because you wrote some of the songs. He wrote some of the songs. Right?,

 Yeah.,

 You were the writers the two of you.,

 The two of us were the main writers. George wrote Something in the Way She Moves and...,

 Not bad.,

 ... Here goesHere Comes the Sun. Something in the Way She Moves is a Harrison song. Frank Sinatra used to call it his favorite Lennon-McCartney.,

 He said it right here on this show.,

 Did he?,

 I said not Lennon-McCartney. One of his favorite all-time songs anywhere Something in the Way She Moves.,

 Yeah. Its a great song. Hes a great writer. Yeah but John and I were the main writers.,

 Do you ever think that he got more credit than you?,

 No. Iwhats happened since he died is that...,

 Theres a martyrdom. ... certaincertain peopletheres a martyrdom thatI had an interview on the day he died when he said The one last thing I want to ever be is a martyr. Of course that is what happened., He died young., 

 You cant blame people. You know theres a lot of sympathy. Its such a shocking way to go that you want to try and give him everything. But the trouble is there was a little bit of revisionism where certain people were saying Well Paul the only thing Paul ever did was quoteThe only thing Paul ever did was book the studio. That kind of thing gets a little bit...,

 That would bug me because you wrote how many of these?,

 A bunch of stuff.,

 A lotmosta lot of the hits you wrote.,

 I wrote a bunch of them yeah.,

 So when...,

 And so you know John and I wrote a lot together and then we wrote a lot separately. And of the ones I wrote theres quite a few of them well-known.,

 You and Yoko get along?,

 We dont not get along. But you know its like some people you may be destined to not become great buddies with. So its not that we dont get along just we dont talk much. You know we talk if we have to.,

 So its not...,

 I dont kind of ring up Hey Yoko whats happening babe? We dont do that.,

 How about Ringo?,

 Yeah I love him. Hes my dear friend. I spoke to him and George. Were great buddies. We always will be.,

 Hows George doing with the cancer?,

 Hes good. Hes excellent.,

 He did surgery right?,

 Yeah. So I understand. You know I dont know really much about it. I just know hes been on well and he had some surgery. But...,

 Do you talk frequently?,

 Yeah I saw him a couple of weeks ago.,

 You dont ask about the cancer or anything?,

 Well I do but I let him tell me and then I dont tell people on nationwide television in case he wants to keep it private.,

 Is he OK though?,

 Yeah. Hes great. Hes gorgeous yeah.,

 Did you ever think of doing something the three of you?,

 We did the Beatles anthology to kind of wrap it all up.,

 That makes sense.,

 Yeah people would say Are you going to reunion? and do stuff like that. But I certainlyfor me if we were on stage the three of us thered be someone missing. Id look over there and thered be someone missing and thatd be John you know.,

 The great...,

 And so I wouldnt want to do it for that reason.,

 The great Arthur Fiedler told me once that when you set a toneyou broke rules The Beatles harmonically you broke rules with regard to the way you wrote cord rules you broke and that you lived for that and the true music impresario would know that. Were you always musically aware? In other words are you first a musician?,

 Yeah absolutely. My dad was an amateur musician who played piano and trumpet until his teeth gave out. So he was like really good. He played by ear and he was great. He wrote some stuff. He wrote a little song. I always remember to my childhood this tune: da-da-da-da-dah-da-dah doo-deedly-bah. You know real 20s stuff. He was in a little band called...,

 You are first a musician?,

 Yeah definitely.,

 Are you a good guitarist?,

 Im great Larry.,

 Great guitarist.,

 Im certainly...,

 I mean how do you measure yourself?,

 Im good yeah. Im good.,

 Because some people say...,

 Im modest too. You know...,

 Thats Liverpool.,

 Hey come on.,

 Were back with Paul McCartney. The book is Blackbird Singing. Weve discussed the death of John Lennon. Tell me about this lyric.,

 This is called Here Today and it was a song I wrote after John died. I was just thinking about him and remembrance of the good times and not so good times. And I was just having an imaginary conversation with him and so its...,

 Did you record it?,

 Here you go. Yeah its on my new record. Its called Here Today. It saysAnd if I said I really knew you well what would your answer be if you were here today? Well knowing you youd probably laugh and say that we were worlds apart if you were here today. But as for me I still remember how it was before and Im holding back the tears no more. I love you. What about the time we met? Well I suppose you could say that we were playing hard to get. Didnt understand a thing but we could always sing. What about the night we cried because there wasnt any reason left to keep it all inside? Never understood a word but you were always there with a smile. And if I say I really loved you and was glad you came along then you are here today for you are in my song.,

 Did that go through rewrites?,

 No.,

 That came right out?,

 That wasthat just spilled out yeah.,

 How long did it take you to write that?,

 Half an hour something like that. If youre really lucky they just arrive and you kind of just write them down.,

 By the way with The Beatles did usually the music come first then the lyric or the lyric then the music or all together?,

 All together. All together yeah. ThatsI only once or twice wrote words and then put a tune to it. That hardly ever happened.,

 Usually its music right?,

 Music yeah. You normally start with a kind of a guitar or something like dum-dum-dum-dum-dum-dum. Then you go lub- dee-bah-bah doe-bee-do-dah-be-doo-dah-doo-be-dah. And youre this and you kind of go doe-be-doo-dah-bah. Picks up the rice in the church. What am I saying? Picks up the rice. Oh well well thats an old lady.,

 How did you come up with that name Eleanor Rigby?,

 I had a friend. We had an actress friend that we worked with in the film Help who was called Eleanor Bron. So I liked the name Eleanor. I was looking for a real second name. Eleanor Williams is OK. Eleanor Hargrey (ph)it had to be two syllables. And I was walking around in Bristol and saw a shop Rigby. I thought: You know thats kind of a nice name. Its ordinary but its special.,

 Now we had Jerk of All Jerks. This is the poem.,

 Yeah.,

 Explain how you came up with this.,

 Well you know what happened waswhere are we? There. What happened was on the day that John got shot I think like everyone in the world there was this horror that someone we loved could just be mown down. It was like the Kennedy thing you know for a lot of people. They all remembered where they were.,

 How could one little person do this?,

 You know how could this happen? And obviously for me it was just horrifying that that was it. No more John. You know oh my God. I wanted to say this to him. I want to ring him. You know you get that I think when you lose very special people. And at the end of the day after all the tears and all the newscasts and all the pundits who said John Lennon wasand Id really said nothing. I couldnt really say anything. I just spurted out a phrase that was meaningless. The phrase that came to me was jerk of all jerks. I just kept thinking the guy who did this was the jerk of all jerks. So I ended up writing a poem about it.,

 Do a little.,

 Do you want to do a bit? Jerk of all Jerks. Im a motorist that quite likes to drive when he drinks who causes the loss of innocent lives. Im the guy with the pistol who kills your best friend. You cant really blame me because Im round the bend. Hello. How are you? Im jerk of all jerks. Im here to undo all your charitable works. I do it quite simply by making mistakes and one little boo-boo is all that it takes and youre at the mercy of jerk of all jerks.  Im the man that disposes of nuclear waste. Theres no need to worry its perfectly safe. In fact there is now every reason to hope that if anything happens Ill easily cope. Hello. How are you? Im jerk of all jerks. Im the leader who says as he wages his war that the children are not ones that hes aiming for. Hello. How are you? Im the jerk of all jerks. You know him dont you?,

 Yeah.,

 You know this guy? Yeah.,

 Yeah. They executed him yesterday.,

 There you go.,

 On Monday rather. Yeah yesterday morning I guess. Boy itwhew. Now...,

 Yeah.,

 ... poem istheres no spare word in a poem right?,

 Hopefully.,

 The truth of a poem isrighttheres no word thats wasted.,

 Hopefully. Yeah.,

 Do you enjoy writing as much as you do performing?,

 Yeah. I think so. Yeah. Two completely different things. Writing you know is a cerebral thing. Youre really trying to be economical. Youre trying to get it right. Performing youre reaching out to people. Youve got to look at them and relate to them. I think writings more a solitary thing.,

 Performing brings though applause.,

 Hopefully.,

 And thats a kind of love thing isnt it?,

 Yeah.,

 We love you...,

 Yeah.,

 ... when they applaud.,

 Yeah.,

 And you cant get that anywhere else but on the stage.,

 Oh yes you can Larry.,

 Ah yes.,

 You can get I love you in other places.,

 Were back with Paul McCartney. The occasion is the publication of Blackbird Singing. And later an extra added attraction. We asked our Internet people to ask questions of Paul McCartney. We picked a few out that we received thousands. And a lot dealt with Linda. And the question they asked was What was the most important thing youd like people to know about your late wife?,

 About Linda? I think they probably would know it anyway that she was a beautiful kind woman.,

 We all knew that from just looking at her.,

 Yes. Well Id like people to remember that you know.,

 How do you deal with loss?,

 Im taking of picture of you in my camera watch here Larry. Just a little...,

 Youre what?,

 Just a little modern gimmick Ive got going here.,

 Thats a camera watch?,

 Thats a camera watch. I just took a picture of you. Can you see that?,

 Look you played it. Can we see this? There it is.,

 There it is look at that larry king live.,

 A camera watch.,

 Yes sir. I was doing an interview with some guy. And hes playing around with it. And I said What is that? He said Its a camera watch. He said Get me one. And he did. He knew the people. So...,

 And then you could print them out.,

 Sorry what was your question? I was fooling around here.,

 Dealing with loss?,

 How do you deal with loss?,

 I mean this was the woman you were with how many years 30 years?,

 I cried30 years. I cried a lot.,

 You knew it was coming.,

 Yes we knew it was coming but youwe tried to pretend we didnt know it was coming. And the last couple of weeks I knew it was coming. I dont know. Its just impossible to talk about or...,

 I dont want to dwell on it. Do you get angry?,

 No not really angry no. I cried a lot. That was the truth of the matter. I just though some friends of mine particularly some of the doctors who were kind of advisingthey said throw yourself into work. Get busy. Do stuff. Do stuff. And I just couldnt. So I just thought that doesnt sound right to me. So I didnt do anything. I just let it all happen. So sometimes Ill be sitting around with people and just burst out crying. And instead of doing the manly thing and say Im sorry I shouldnt do it I would just go Woo and just cried a lot.,

 In a business where women are at your fingertips I mean rock stars and whos bigger than the Beatles how did your relationship last so long?,

 We loved each other quite simple. I think the other thing was wed both sown our wild oats before we got together. So Id known a lot of girls. Shed known a lot of guys. And I think we were kind of fed up with playing the field by the time we got together. And we loved each other. So we were able to say You know what? Lets knock that stuff on the head and lets get it on.,

 Did you get mad at cancer?,

 Yes yes.,

 Some people...,

 I still do you know. I still do. I think you know its a terrible thing thatI remember when I was at school which is you know 30 years ago. Now its more than 30 years ago being asked to give a donation for cancer. And here we are and this still isnt cured. I think we were looking at it getting cured and all that. And so its scary that it isnt cured and thatbut I dont. You just have to hope for the best and hope that it will soon get cured with the sort of genetic thing. I dont know.,

 You sort of keep her memory alive though dont you?,

 Yes.,

 I mean do you work at it?,

 Well you know I dont really have to. Shes all around me. You know and everybody I know knows her and remembers her. And so I talk a lot about her. Shes in the book the poems to her in the book (UNINTELLIGIBLE).,

 At the end of the program were going to meet your girlfriend.,

 Yes.,

 It is right?,

 Yes.,

 Has she handled this well knowing of your feelings for...,

 Yes I think shes handled it particularly well because its obviously not easy.,

 Obviously.,

 When someones loved someone for 30 years. I think its different if it was a divorce because you can say ah the old (UNINTELLIGIBLE). Ill get rid of her. Come on honey. But why am I talking American? I dont know because Im on your show.,

 Because youre a guy from Brooklyn yes. How did Wings get together?,

 After the Beatles I had to decide whether I was going to give up the music business whether I was going to continue with music. And it was an easy decision. I decided I couldnt. So I just was talking to Linda. And I said you know how would you feel if we got a band together? And would you be in it with me because I like need a friend? She said well I dont know how to do anything. And said yes but bands dont when they start up forgetting that...,

 there?,

 Yes you know nobody knows how to do it. The Beatles were stars nobody knew how to do it. It was a couple of guys with three chords but forgetting that you have a lot of time to make your mistakes in private when youre a young because now I would make these mistakes in public. But we had a lot of fun. ,

 So Wings was not like an ordinary start up group and thats going to get paid attention to?,

 Nowell exactly yes. So we got a lot of criticism any mistakes we made. But we had a lot of fun. We went right back to the roots and just did it all again and enjoyed it.,

 By the way theres a new two disk compilation titled Wingspan. Capitol Records will announce the album as doneas gone double platinum in the United States. And a recent People magazine says that Wings brought us the purest pop for pops purest decade that brief period after music stopped selling revolution and before it began selling naval rings. So youwhat are you doing now? Do you sing?,

 I sing. Im here in Los Angeles to maketo finish up a new record.,

 As just Sir Paul McCartney or as a group?,

 Oh its just Paul McCartney yes. Its just yes its not a group. Its justI work with a group. And it comes out under my name.,

 CD or a single song?,

 CD yes CD new album.,

 You wrote them?,

 Yes.,

 Do you ever sing anybody elses material?,

 Not on record. Off the record I do.,

 In concerts you will?,

 I dont think I do actually. No I think its nearly always my stuff.,

 Another...,

 Sometimes some old rock and roll.,

 Another Internet question. What one song youve written has the most personal meaning to you?,

 There are a few. Its always difficult to choose one you know.,

 Yes I know. ,

 So My Love maybe Im Amazed very special because I wrote them for Linda. So they will always have a special meaning. Here Today because I wrote that for John. I think those kind of songs. Theres a more recent one called Little Willow that I wroteI think songs like that then it doesnt mean theyre any better but they have more meaning because I wrote them for a reason.,

 What was the biggest McCartney written hit?,

 Yesterday.,

 An amazing song.,

 Not bad.,

 Yes. Where did that come from that?,

 It came in a dream unto me. I woke up one morning and I heard...,

 The music too?,

 Yes only the music. So I thought thats a good tune. I wonder what that is. Yes. And I had a piano by my bed like you do.,

 Oh everyone...,

 As most people. And I was sitting at my piano. Anyway so I said What is this tune? I blocked it out. Then I went to all my friends John first George Martin our producer. I said What is this tune? He said I dont know but its good. I couldnt believe Id written it.,

 What does it meanthat youve heard it somewhere?,

 Yes Id heard it. I thought it was so complete. And I used tobecause I didnt have any words I used to sing Scrambled eggs oh my baby how I love your legs. But I thought that cannot stay. Weve got to look for other lyrics. So over the next couple of weeks I got the real words.,

 Did Yesterday just drop at you like that?,

 Yes. Yes. The words took a little longer but the tune itself came just complete came just out of a dream. So youve got to believe in magic.,

 Yes.,

 The thing about songwriting its quite a mystical thing how people do it you know. It sort of just come to you if youre lucky.,

 Ella Gardner told me that Misty he thought someone had written it because he couldnt read any music and it was going through his head?,

 Me and Ella thats because I cant read or write music either.,

 You cant read or write music?,

 No.,

 So when you think of something someone has to write it down?,

 Or Ive got to remember it. Me and John always used to say because wewhen we first started it was before anything like tape cassettes which we later used to just immediately put it down. Said okay remember. And we said what if we forget it? We said so you know if we forget it it cant be much good. How are going to expect them to remember if we just wrote it and we forgot it?,

 When Paul you make it and have it all whatyoure going to be 59-years old right? What goals do you now have? I mean it cant be financial.,

 No.,

 OK. It cant beare there are artistic goals left?,

 Yes. I...,

 Like what?,

 Well you know Im still looking to write a great song. You always are. You know you never think well thats enough. Well thats good enough.,

 Thats right. Irving Berlin was writing into his 90s.,

 Exactly. Yes how cool was that? And he wasso I would always hope to be able to just write a better song. You know I was looking to do that. But I like a lot of things. I like poetry. I paint. Theres a lot of stuff I do.,

 Where do you live?,

 I live in England two hours south of London.,

 You have high security?,

 Yes.,

 I just dont want what happened to John...,

 Yes.,

 What happened to George...,

 Yes. ,

 You must worry?,

 Yes well I dont worry you know because...,

 You dont?,

 No because the moment the man upstairs wants me Im his. You know its call.,

 You believe that?,

 Yes I know that. You know.,

 You know that?,

 Well I know that at some point Im going to die. And thats it. So I dont worry about it.,

 But you do have security?,

 I tried to avoid it by the way.,

 Yes.,

 You know Im not...,

 Good thinking. But I mean do you think Linda is somewhere?,

 Yes.,

 Do you feel that?,

 Yes.,

 That sensitive that...,

 Shes here sort of in this kind of dimensional thing. I dont know. I dont have any sort of very strong religious beliefs but I have kind ofIm a spiritual feelings about that kind of thing.,

 What American artists flip you?,

 Elvis Presley the king.,

 The first right.,

 Absolutely yes. Greatest.,

 Who else out of that rock...,

 Little Richard who always says it on TV. Paul you know he said you know I taught you everything you know. I said Thats right Richard. Its true. Little Richard was fantastic. Jerry Lee Louis Jean Vincent all of them. And then the next wave was Motown Marvyn Gaye and Smokey Robinson and all the town with Motown.,

 What do you like now?,

 What do I like now? Nat King Cole. Im going backwards Larry. The very thought of you...,

 Now he had a voice like no voice.,

 Really cool.,

 (UNINTELLIGIBLE).,

 I love him yes. And I talk to her about it. I tell her its about my favorite song. Me and Heathers favorite song is...,

 Unforgettable?,

 No The Very Thought of You.,

 Oh.,

 You know that one?,

 And (UNINTELLIGIBLE) the little ordinary things that everyone ought to do.,

 Well exactly.,

 I see your face in every flower. I know songs.,

 You do know that one. Its a great song.,

 Did you like Sinatra?,

 Written by an Englishman there too. Yes I did like Sinatra a lot. I didnt appreciate him when I was younger. I love him now. I think its a sort of romance thing too. That kind of stuff is really romantic music.,

 Do you like rap?,

 I like it. I dont really listen to a lot of it. I like some of the Eminem stuff because its kind of clever. I like the rhythm. I like the attitude. And I can imagine if I was a young kid now Id like that.,

 Do you ever hear a song where you say I wish I wrote that.,

 One or two yes.,

 One or two?,

 One or two.,

 Like The Very Thought of You?,

 Very Thought of You would have been good to have written.,

 President Barack Obama is next on larry king live. President Obama faces enormous challenges on his 500th day in office. I sat down with him at the White House today to discuss some of them. And we began by talking about an environmental disaster that has no end in sight. Mr. President thank you for being with us on our 25th anniversary week.,

 Larry congratulations on 25 wonderful years.,

 Thank you. Its been a special honor. ,

 Unbelievable.,

 And an honor to be here and be with you.,

 Thank you.,

 I know youre going down to the Gulf again. But theres a question that a lot of us are pondering. After this is over what about hurricanes? What about oil raining down? have we thought about what were going to do when its over?,

 Well this is an unprecedented oil spill. We havent seen likeanything like this before. And thats why the minute that the rig blew up and then sank down to the bottom of the ocean I called in my entire team. And I have to tell you Larry that the worst case scenario was even worse than what were seeing now because...,

 This is worse than what you thought it would be?,

 No no no. What Im saying is it could have...,

 Oh.,

 been even worse. So we realized right away this was going to be a big event a big problem and that we had to put everything we had into it. So right away we started mobilizing our Coast Guard making sure that we are putting pressure on BP to activate their response. Eventually we ended up sending our top scientists. We now have about 100 of the top scientists from around the world in our national labsto look over BPs shoulder in terms of figuring out how theyre going to plug the well. And we also knew though that ultimately the only way to relieve the well safely is to drill what are called these relief wells. Now BP and other oil companies traditionally just drill one. We said drill two in case one of them doesnt work. But that takes some time. It takes about three months. In the meantime theyve been experimenting with a whole bunch of other ways that they can capture the oil. But weve had a big spill. And we know that its going to be a long response a long cleanup. And my commitment has always beenfor the last 40 some days to make sure that we are doing everything we can to mitigate the damage to help clean up help recover because this is an area that already got battered during hurricane season. And this is an area that is a concern not only for the economy of the Gulf but also for an entire way of life. ,

 Have the scientists discussed what about a hurricane?,

 You know Wolf I didI had a Situation Room meeting about a week-and-a-half ago where we got the report that this could be a more severe than normal hurricane season. And I asked well how does a potential oil spill interact with a hurricane? And it turns out thatand now these are all estimations and probabilities. It turns out that a big powerful hurricane ironically is probably less damaging with respect to the oil spill because it just disperses everything and the oil breaks up andand degrades more quickly. Its those tropical storms and tides that would just wash stuff into the marshes that would really be an ecological disaster. But look weweve got a couple of tasks right now. Number one BP has to shut down this well. Now the only guarantee to shut it down is the relief well and thats going to take a couple of months. In the meantime we hope that by cutting the riser and putting a cap on this thing they can funnel up the oil and that will help. In the meantime weve still got all these barrels of oil that are sloshing around in the Gulf. They move with the currents. We dont always know where they are. But what we can do is make sure that our response doesnt hold anything back that we put everything weve got into Louisiana which has been hardest hit so far; Alabama Mississippi and Florida.,

 Senator Nelson wants the Defense Department he says more fully involvedmore troops.,

 Yes. You know I think that theres a mistaken understanding. First of all the Coast Guard is part of our armed services and theyre responsible for the coordinating along with the responsible partyin this case BPto make sure that recovery efforts are top notch. And what Ive said to Thad Allen whos the national incident coordinator and is somebody who has been dealing with oil spills for 39 years now is whatever you need you will get.,

 So if he says troops hell get troops?,

 If heif he says that theres equipment thats helpful in dealing with this problem he will get it. But keep in mind that all this stuff has to be coordinated. Right now weve got over 20000 people who are working there. Weve authorized the activation of 17000 National Guardsmen. Weve got 1700 vessels already in the water. And you know what you dont want is a situation where everybody is stepping on each other and not doing the best possible job in coordination with the state and local levels.,

 What part of it is your baby? what part of it is the country and not BP?,

 Well BP caused this spill. We dont yet know exactly what happened. But whether its a combination of human error them cutting corners on safety or a whole other variety of variables theyre responsible. So theyve got to pick up thethe tab for the cleanup the damages fishermen who are unable to fish right in the middle of their most important season. And my job is to make sure that they are being held accountable that we get to the bottom of how this happened that they are paying what theyre supposed to be paying that they cap this well. In terms of actually solving the problem BP has particular expertise when it comes to capping the well. Theyve got the equipment thatthat our Defense Departmentthe first thing I asked was do we have some equipment that they dont have? And they along with other oil companies have the best equipment and have the best technology to deal with the well at the bottom of the ocean. What we have a responsibility for is to make sure that the recovery efforts the mitigation efforts along the coastline making sure that fishermen and businesses that are being affected are getting paid properly making sure that local people are being hiredall those efforts are ones where we can do it better. And so what weve said is youre going to pay. You will coordinateBPwith us. But ultimately if we say that you need to deploy folks over there or you need to compensate such and such here or you need to for example most recently help to dredge up and create some barrier islands in some selective areas of Louisiana in accordance with some of the ideas that the state had down there then you need to do it.,

 SomeI know youyou appear so calm. Are you angry at BP?,

 You know I am furious at this entire situation because this is an example of where somebody didnt think through the consequences of their actions. And it is imperiling not just a handful of people this isthis is imperiling an entire way of life and an entire region for potentially years. So...,

 Has the company felt your anger?,

 Well they have felt the anger. But what I havent seen as much as Id like is the kind of rapid response. Now they want to solve the problem too because this is costcosting them a lot of money. And the one thing that I think is important to underscore is that I would love to just spend a lot of my time venting and yelling at people. But thats not the job I was hired to do. My job is to solve this problem. And ultimately this isnt about me and how angry I am. Ultimately this is about the people down in the Gulf who are being impacted and what am I doing to make sure that theyre able to salvage their way of life? And thats going to be the main focus that Ive got in the weeks and months ahead.,

 Governor Jindal the governor of Louisiana hes asked you tohes got concerns about the impact of stoppingof the moratorium you have on drilling. And now thats been extended toto the shallow waters as well. What would you say to him?,

 Well actually the moratorium has not extended to the shallow waters. Its only...,

 Oh thats wrong?,

 Its only theits only the deep water wells that weve placed a moratorium. Look weve just seen an environmental disaster thats come about because these oil companies said they had a plan to deal with the worst case scenario and obviously it wasnt a very good plan because its not working Larry. And nobody is being impacted more than the citizens of Louisiana Bobby Jindals state So I have said in the past that we need to transition to a more clean energy future. But were not going to do that overnight. Weve got to have domestic oil production. And I am supportive of offshore drilling if it can be done safely and it doesnt result in these kinds of horrible environmental disasters. And the problem Ive got is until Ive got a review that tells me A what happened; B how do you prevent a blowout of the sort that we saw; C if even if its a one in a million chance something like this happens again that we actually know how to deal with it. Until that happens it would be irresponsible of me to lift that moratorium.,

 A couple of other things. Former President Carter has condemned the Israeli raid against those ships in thethe flotilla trying to break the blockade of Gaza. Where do you stand on that? A former American president has condemned it.,

 Well you know the United States with the other members of the U.N. Security Council said very clearly that we condemned all the acts that led up to this violence. It was a tragic situation. Youve got loss of life that was unnecessary. And so we are calling for an effective investigation of everything that happened. And I think that the Israelis are going to agree to thatan investigation of international standardsbecause they recognize that this cant be good for Israels long-term security. Heres what weve got. Youve got a situation in which Israel has legitimate security concerns when theyve got missiles raining down on cities along the Israel/Gaza border. Ive been to those towns and seen the holes that were made by missiles coming through peoples bedrooms. So Israel has a legitimate concern there. On the other hand youve got a blockade up that is preventing people in Palestinian Gaza from having job opportunities and being able to create businesses and engage in trade and have opportunity for the future. I think whats important right now is is that we break out of the current impasse use this tragedy as an opportunity so that we figure out how can we meet Israels security concerns but at the same time start opening up opportunity for Palestinians work with all parties concernedthe Palestinian Authority the Israelis the Egyptians and othersandand I think Turkey can have a positive voice in this whole process once weve worked through this tragedyand bring everybody together to figure out how can we get a two-state solution where Palestinians and Israelis can live side by side in peace and security.,

 Its premature then to condemn Israel?,

 Well II think that we need to know what all the facts are. But its not premature to say to the Israelis and to say to the Palestinians and to say to all the parties in the region that the status quo is unsustainable. We have been trying to do this piecemeal for decades now and it just doesnt work. Youve got to have a situation in which the Palestinians have real opportunity and Israels neighbors recognize Israels legitimate security concerns and are committed to peace.,

 You met with the Arizona governor today.,

 Um-hmm.,

 Will the administration bring a legal challenge to that law?,

 You know Im not going to comment on that Larry because thats really the job of the Justice Department. And you know I made a commitment early on that I wouldnt be putting my handthumb on the scales when these kinds of decisions are made. Ive expressed a personal opinion which is that although I understand the frustration of the people of Arizona when it comes to the inflow of illegal immigrants I dont think this is the right way to do it. I think this puts American citizens who look Hispanic are Hispanic potentially in a unfair situation and...,

 But youre not going to ,

 And more importantly it also creates the prospects of 50 different laws in 50 different states when it comes to immigration. This is a federal job. What we have to do is take on that federal responsibility by working with border states on border security. And I told Governor Brewer that weve already put more resources into border security than we ever have. We have got more border guards in Arizona than we ever had. Weve gotwe just made decisions to put in additional National Guard. But without comprehensive immigration reform that is Congress responsibility we are not going to solve this problem and thats what we have to do.,

 A couple of other quick things because I know we have a little bit of a time limit. First do you still like this job?,

 Well this is the best job on earth. I mean its aits an extraordinary privilege to be able to wake up every day and know that you have the opportunity to serve the American people andand make their lives a little bit better or maybe its the next generations lives a little bit better. And...,

 No matter what a poll says?,

 You know what the truth of the matter is is that given everything weve gone through my poll numbers are doing all right.,

 Its 48 percent. Is that all right?,

 You know theweve gone through the worst recession since the Great Depression. Weve got two wars going on right now. Weve had multiple crises that have cropped up and people still havent fully recovered in terms of their job losses in terms of whats happening in housing. So you know people I think understandably are frustrated. But what theyre starting to see is that the economy is getting better. We had the biggest job growth in years last month and I think well have decent job growth this month...,

 Tomorrow it will come out.,

 Tomorrow well get an announcement. Businesses are starting to invest again. Manufacturing is stronger than its been. The investments that we made early onsome of which were controversialare paying off. If you look at just to give you one example the auto industry. I mean G.M. is now turning a profit and hiring again. And the banks as frustrating as you know the situation of having to bail them out was they are repaying that money. And so a lot of the decisions that are being made are starting to pan out. But were not out of the woods yet. People are still hurting. And you know it is a great privilege for me to have the most interesting job in the world and one where every once in a while Ill get a letter from somebodyyou know II was traveling through Iowa. A woman comes up to me and says you know what that healthcare bill you passed Im a small business woman Im going to take advantage of that credit this year. This is going to help me and I might be able to hire somebody else because you just gave me the chance to get decent healthcare.,

 And one other thing. LeBron James is with us tomorrow night. We pre-interviewed him. And he says all things being equal hes probably leaning toward Cleveland. Thats where he grew up in Akron. But he grew up a Bull fan. You want him to go to Chicago right?,

 No no no. I...,

 What did you say?,

 I want to be clear. What Iwhat I said to...,

 Clear it up.,

 First of all LeBron Ive had a chance to meet hima wonderful young man an amazing talent. What I said to him wasII didnt say it to him I said it to Marv Albert. He needs to be in a place where hes got a coach and a team around him that can do what Phil Jackson and the Bulls did for Michael Jordan. Michael Jordan couldnt win a championship on his own. Its all about having a team concept that works. And he hasnt quite gotten that yet and he needs to find that situation. Ill be honest with youand my folks in Chicago may be mad at me for saying this but I think it would be a wonderful story if LeBron says you know what Im going to stay here in Cleveland. You know hes from Ohio. You know thatthats a town that has had some tough times. For him to say...,

 Wow!,

Im going to make a commitment to this city you know I think would be a wonderful thing. But hes got to make sure that hes got a team around him and a coach that he respects hes bought into a team concept hes willing to be coached. Andand if he does that hell have an even more remarkable career than hes having right now.,

 I saw you singing to Michelle last night withwith Paul McCartney. That was a pretty nice kick huh?,

 Letlet me tell you theI think that was one of the highlights that Michelles had is when Paul McCartney sings Michelle. To her you knowwhen she was a little girl growing up on the south side of Chicago I suspect she didnt think that was ever going to happen.,

 Thank you Mr. President.,

 Thank you Larry. Appreciate you.,

 Thanks for celebrating with us.,

 Congratulations again.,

 On this our 25th anniversary week here at CNN were so excited to welcome Lady Gaga to larry king live§. Shes the Grammy- winning singer songwriter musician performance artist whose provocative videos have been viewed more than one billion times online. And later in the show were going to give you a sneak peek of her latest video Alejandro. She just received five world music awards in May and is one of the top winners at the 2010 Brit Awards. Lady Gaga has sold more than 15 million albums and 40 million singles worldwide. And TIME magazine recently published this annual list of the 100 Most Influential People in the World. Lady Gaga was on the cover as one of those people. Were you surprised at that?,

 Yes of course. I was so surprised. I didnt even imagine that I would make the list at all. And I was so excited and I am very blessed to have the wonderful fans that I do who voted for me. Should I call you Larry or should I call you King Larry?,

 Well King Larry would be a great honor but lets do Larry and Ill do Gaga.,

 OK.,

 OK. You were born Stefaniwhy did you change yourhow did you come up with Lady Gaga? ,

 Well it was actually a nickname that some of my friends called me in New York. I was doing these performance art pop music pieces in the city. And they were a bit on the eccentric side I suppose. So people started to call me Gaga after the Queen song Radio Gaga.,

 At what age growing up Gaga did you know that you wanted to be a performer?,

 In the womb Larry. In my mothers warm womb.,

 At your birth.,

 Yes at my birth. I guess you could say its always been my destiny to be a performer. I used to perform even just in restaurants with my family or in the living room. But its been really a very exciting transition now that I get to do this for a living. And I just refuse to stop. I probably should take a break and go on vacation. But Id rather die on stage. Not under a palm tree.,

 Before you were a performer did you have any other jobs?,

 Yes well I was a waitress for many years. And a bartender. And I was a go-go dancer briefly as well. I used to make a lot of money to pay for demos and flyers that I used to post up all around the NYU area on the lower east side to get people to come see my shows. I got a job when I was 15 because my allowance was about $20 a week which in New York was impossible. So I used to waitress across the street from where I grew up. And I used to take all the money I made waitressing so that I could go watch jazz downtown.,

 Wow. You said that people use the word icon carelessly. Do you consider yourself an icon?,

 No I do not. I hope when Im dead Ill be considered an icon though.,

 Who are your icons? Who does Lady Gaga look up to?,

 Who do I look up to? My mother. My grandmother. I love Princess Diana. So much. She haswas an enormous influence on me when I was younger because my mother worshipped her so much. Her story how she began what she married into how her society affected her as a woman. I was always very fascinated with Princess Diana. When she died it wasIll never forget. My mother was crying sitting on the couch watching the news and I was very young. And it was this very powerful moment in my childhood watching my mother so connected to someone. So I guess you could say she is one of my biggest icons. As well as you know David Bowie wonderful. And ,

 Did the family encourage you to sing and dance and perform?,

 Yes. My mother was actually in musical theater when she was younger and my dad was in a Bruce Springsteen cover band for many years. He was a real Jersey Shore boy. And they were always very supportive. They alwaysyou know I think more than anything in my house growing up my parents instilled a very strong work ethic in me and my sisters. So as long as I worked hard at whatever it is that I wanted to do they were OK with me doing it. But if I was ever lazy I wouldI would reckon that they would perhaps not want me to do it.,

 Theres been a lot of stories and stories so often wrong about your health. How are you?,

 Im OK thank you Larry. How are you?,

 Im OK. I mean you look great. Is there any there was a story about lupus or something? Do you have lupus?,

 You know lupus is in my family and it is genetic. And its so funny because my mother told me the other day that my fans were quite worried about me because they did talk about the fact that I was tested for lupus. And the truth is I dont show any signs any symptoms of lupus. But I have tested borderline positive for the disease. So as of right now I doI do not have it. But I have to take good care of myself.,

 Yes sure you have to be very precautionary. Death though is a theme in a number of your performances. Youre only 24. Youve been eaten by a giant Anglo fish on stage crushed by a falling chandelier during a 2009 MTV Music. Do you think about dying?,

 Yes I do. Iyou know I ,

 At age 24?,

 Its something Iwell I dream about it a lot. You know II dont know. I suppose I could lie to you and not tell you the truth but the truth is I do think about it. The Anglo fish in the show actually was my childhood monster. My big fear was of the Anglo fish. So it was kind of comical to use it in the show that I battle my childhood fear every night before the finale. But I dont know. I actuallyI am a good friend with Deepak Chopra who I speak to a lot about my dreams. And he seems to think its nothing really to worry about. He tells me that Im very creative and I should learn to embrace my insanity and not worry so much because I always call him and saying Deepak I had this most horrible morbid dream. What does it all mean? And he says youre just very creative. Put it on stage.,

 Of course Deepak is on this program a lot. He never worries about anything. He doesnt. Hes a wonderful person.,

 He is a wonderfulhe is a wonderful person. I wish I could be more like that. But you know I think part of my fascination with it as well as why it is in this show is that the show is a celebration of shame. The show is a rejection of insecurity. The monster ball is in essence an exorcism for my fans and for myself where we sort of put everything out on the table and reject it. There is so much in the show about insecurity and struggle. And so many of my fans are really really really troubled. And I was really troubled. And I still am fairly troubled. So I guess you can say I relate to my fans in that way. And I choose not to hide from it. Im not interested Larry in being a perfect placid pop singer that looks great in bikinis and is on the cover of every magazine. Im more interested in helping my fans to love who they are and helping them to reject prejudice and reject those things that theyre taught from society to not like themselves.,

 Well said.,

 Feel like freaks.,

 Much morewell take a break ,

 Like theyre not wanted.,

 Were back with Lady Gaga. Its our 25th anniversary week. Were honored to have her be one of our featured guests. Bill Gates will be with us tomorrow night. And Lebron James Friday night. Were very diversified. We have a question for you Gaga. Its on our Facebook page. Is it true that Michael Jackson wanted to perform with you on his This Is It comeback tour?,

 You know its always very difficult because I dont necessarily like to talk about those very personal things that happened. But I guess I can speak about it now. I was actually asked to open for Michael on his tour. And we were going to open for him at the O2 and we were working on making it happen.,

 Wow.,

 And I suppose I believe there was some talk about uslots of the openers doing duets with Michael on stage. Sobut Michaels death was devastating for me regardless of whether or not I was supposed to go on tour with him. He is such an inspiration and remarkable human being. And I guess I suppose Larry some of my fascination with death and the demise of the celebrity goes along with me watching these hugely iconic and amazing people that I have heralded and admired my whole life become destroyedwhether self-destroyed or destroyed by the media.,

 How did you come up with the ideathe incredible idea of these costumes? Of not just singing and dancing but the way you present yourself. How did that come about?,

 Well some of the things I wear are obviously created for me by designers or theyre recreations of archives of things worn in the 70s and in the 80s. But lots of the newer more original pieces theyre meant to be kind of a rejection of what people view about women. I guess Im a feminist. I am a feminist. And I want to change the way people view women and changeI guess its not quite sure what she definitely means by her work but Marina Bromovich the performance artist she seems to be quite limitless and she seems to say that somehow she or we create our own limits. So I guess Im trying to push the limits push the boundaries as much as I can. And I also really lovelove the way I dress. And it brings me a personal joy and satisfaction in my own life that I like to share with my fans. I also try to create things that are quite easy for my fans to replicate. Some of them not so much. But some of them are very easy for my fans to replicate and that bonds us in a way. Its quite nice to have this connection to them outside of everything else. Yes.,

 Is there any boundary you wont cross?,

 I suppose Ill justwell youll have to wait Larry. Im not sure. Im not interested in violence. Yes I dont like violence. I hate violence. I dont like negativity. I dont like prejudice. I dont believe in hatred in music. So there are some things I suppose.,

 Well said. You said that your 2008 single Just Dance that single saved your life. That was a quote from The Sunday Observer. How?,

 Well of course people love to take sound bites from nice interviews that I give. But it saved my life I guess injust as in a transitional way in terms of where I was in the journey of my music. And I had moved to Los Angeles and Id been dropped from record labels a few times and been through so many obstacles and told no and rejected youre not pretty enough cant sing enough cant write a song good enough. Youre a freak the weird girl from New York. I mean it was a rejection after rejection. And I wrote this song Just Dance. And it was myits my eureka moment. It was the thing that everyone was able to latch on to the record label the gay community who has been the most enormous blessing of my life that I have them and their support and the way that they truly understand me and support me. And in fact the Alejandro video which will premier very soon but youll see a snippet of it tonight is a celebration of my love and appreciation for the gay community. My admiration of their bravery and their love for one another their courage in their relationships. Its something I have yet toyet to nail on the head with a man Larry.,

 Were back with the fantastic Lady Gaga on this our 25th anniversary week. Well be joined Thursday night by the president of the United States Barack Obama. You said Lady Gaga that you dont touch cocaine anymore. Was it hard to stop doing it?,

 No it wasnt. By the time that I had stopped doing it it was ruining my life. So no I kind of just threw it away I guess.,

 British tabloids say that you recentlyI want to get this right. You walked into a local pub in Birmingham. You had a few drinks and picked up everybodys tab when you left. True?,

 Yes. Whats wrong with buying a few friends a beer?,

 All right. Youre in the midst now of a massive world tour. In fact youre coming to us from the O2 arena in London where youll be performing. What is that pressure like?,

 Yes.,

 To go on that kind of tour?,

 Its a wonderful pressure. Its the most amazing pressure. Its not like any other kind of pressure. Its not under pressure its not water pressure. Its not pressure cooker. Its just wonderful. Its miraculous. Im so blessed. I look out into the audience and I scream and cry and we sing and we cheer and we dance. And I cant believe that 17000 people singing my lyrics or that even know my name. And Im soIm so grateful Larry. I cant say enough about my little monsters my beautiful fans. They inspire me so much. Ive been writing my new album on the road every day. Its been a wonderful experience. Of course I always want to be better but not a bad pressure. A good wonderful pressure.,

 All right. How do you come up with the little monsters idea? What does that mean?,

 Well I wrote the album The Fame Monster which is the second album. And when I had finished I realized that I had written each song about a particular fear that I had come across on my journey promoting the fame. And then when I went on tour my fans were sothey were salivating at the mouth and they couldntthey were rabid. They couldnt wait for me to sing my new songs and they just behaved like monsters onin the audience. So a couple of nights I just said you little monsters. And I hadI had used the lyric on the album as well little monsters. So I just started calling them my little monsters. And before I knew it they were all holding their hands up like this in the audience. And then this became the symbol for the little monster. And now they standthey stand in the audience every night and they dance and they hold up their monster hands.,

 We have a Tweeter question for Lady Gaga Twittered to us. If you werent in show business what do you think youd be doing?,

 I would be dead.,

 Simply put you wouldnt be here?,

 No. I also wouldso much of what I do is hinged on show business. I believe so much in itpeople ask me what do you dress like when youre alone? Do you ever just wear sweat pants or whatever they say. And Im thinking that theythe concept of show business is lost. Michael Jackson when he was being wheeled out of the ambulance when he was burned he held his glitter glove up high above his head to was to his fans because he was show business.,

 You have become a champion of what you call All the Freaks. Now explain isis everybody a freak? Or are you appealing to freaks? Or are there millions of freaks? Explain it?,

 Well III havesince my childhood in school and for a very long time I used to always feel like such a freak. I didnt have very many friends in school. I had a few close friends. And II wasnt a popular girl. And got made fun of every day and couldnt really relate to anyone and didnt want do dress like anyone else and liked different things. And I related to men more than I related to women. And I felt like a freak and I had no where to go. And I guess through the music and the performances weve donethe clothing that Ive worn and as the fan base has begun to grow Ive sort of watched this massive group of misfits join together to liberate themselves. They love the music and they love what the House of Gaga is creating because it has a sense of individuality a sense of freedom a sense of non-conformconformity. And Iand I celebrate that. I joke in the show. at the beginning of the show I say all the freaks are outside and I locked the doors. Itsits kind of the opposite of what youre saying Larry. We believe that we arent the freaks that everyone else is the freaks.,

 Your videos are hugely popular on the Internet. Theyve also been remade by other people like U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan who parody Telephone. Or the 12 year old Gracen Chance (ph) performing Paparazzi. What havedo you like all these imitators?,

 Well yes of course but its actually very interesting that you brought up the soldiers in Afghanistan because I specifically didnt post that one when I saw it. I wanted to put that on my Twitter but I got nervous about posting it on my Twitter because I was not sure how it would be received by the other soldiers or the other you know members of the Army or the administration. So I didnt post it. And then its quite interesting that all thesethese Dont Ask Dont Tell is happening now that its happening because in the Alejandro video there is sort of this homoerotic military theme in the video. And it kind of makes perfect sense doesnt it? Itit all kind of comes together culturally and politically. And IIits no secret that II dont think that anyone should have to hide who they are let alone be discriminated against. We can all fight equally.,

 Sure.,

 But II bring that up specifically because it makes me sad that I saw that video. And I thought it was so great. And I was so excited that over in Afghanistan theyre fighting every day for us and theyre protecting us and doing so much. And they were just having a little down time. And I had to think twice before I posted it because I didnt want anything bad to happen.,

 We have of course gotten tons of Tweets Lady Gaga about the soon to be released video of your song Alejandro. When will it be released?,

 It will be released in just a few days. And I wanted to make sure that my fans had something nice and foreshadowing to watch tonight on LARRY KING.,

 We mentioned Madonna earlier. And many articles wereabout you refer to Madonnacomparisonsparallels. What do you make of all that? What do you think of her?,

 Well I think Madonna is great. Shes been a wonderful friend and a very kind and supportive and amazing. And shesshes such an incredible woman. And you know I get compared to so many people. And were compared to each other whether were blond brunette black white straight gay. But on another level its kind of funny because my mother actually looks sort of likelike Madonna. And the older Ive gotten I look more and more like my mother. So sometimes I just want to say its not my fault that I look like her.,

 Did youdid you have fun doing that skit with her on Saturday Night Live?,

 I did. She is great. We had a blast. We were laughing. Were both quite militant about rehearsals. So we were driving everybody crazy rehearsing over and over and over again. And SNL wanted us to go get ready for the show and we kept going. But she is so great. And of course theno bad comparison to Madonna. Shes wonderful. And there can never be another. So I have to think of even more ways to annoy and shock everyone because shes done everything.,

 Oh. There will never be another you either. Lets go to some other areas. You were raised Catholic. You were raised as a Catholic. What are your feelings toward the church and religion in general?,

 Well I struggle. I struggle with my feelings about the church in particular. But I guess its quite honestly completely separate isnt it? religion and the church are two completely separate things. But in terms of religion Im very religious. I was raised Catholic. I believe in Jesus. I believe in God. Im very spiritual. I pray very much. But at the same time there is no one religion that doesnt hate or speak against or be prejudiced against another racial group or religious group andor sexual group. For that I think religion is also bogus. So I suppose you could say Im a quite religious woman that is very confused about religion. And I dream and envision a future where we have a more peaceful religion or a more peaceful world a more peaceful state of mind for the younger generation. And thats what I dream for.,

 Do you believe you will go somewhere when you pass on?,

 Do I believe in heaven?,

 Yes.,

 Or hell? I believe I will go to heaven but I suppose could go either way couldnt I?,

 You mentioned earlier about this appeal to the gays. Youre an outspoken advocate of gay rights. Why do you think theres such an appeal between you and the gay community? You for them they for you; why?,

 Well I can speak for myself. My admiration for the gay community comes from an incredibly steadfast and joyful courage and very bravery that they have for one another for their community. Toto be gay and to live openly in this society is something that requires a tremendous amount of strength and steadfastness. And I admire that. And I envy it in so many ways because it is something that I as a woman do not always wholeheartedly possess. And I think that my connection to them has actually been just symbiotic and mutual. Theythey know how much I love them. And my music in so many waysmy friends since I was very young were all gay. And they were always my closest friends my purest friendships. Gay men never wanted anything from but my life and my friendship. It wasitsits very different than the relationships with straight men. So I suppose its just very pure. And I celebrate their culture and theirtheir union and who they are through in through in my music and in my fashion and in my work every day. And I will forever.,

 Its out 25th Anniversary week. Tomorrow night Bill Gates. The president of the United States Thursday. And a major surprise Friday night. Lady Gaga is our big surprise tonight. What an honor to have her. What about Dont Ask Dont Tell. You think theyre going to change it?,

 I hope so. You know theres so many things since Dont Ask Dont Tell. Recently I know theyre working on repealing thethe restrictions on blood donors from the gay community. And its just theres so many archaic things floating around in the government right now that are so misinformed and so wrong. And Iits very confusing. Its very confusing for young people especially you know 14 year olds in high school who are getting sent home because they have tea shirts that say gay on it as if gay is a curse word or somehow inappropriate. I just think that in terms of educationsexual education political education and social education schoolsI think its important to be specific about civil rights and a persons worth. No person is worth any less than another human being based on their sexual orientation or religion.,

 You said that your song Poker Face from The Fame is about your own bisexuality. Do youhow do you deal with that? Is thathow do you deal withare you with men more or women more? Do you want to be married? Whatwhat do you think?,

 I deal with it just fine. ImIm looking for love just like everyone else Larry. But right now love is in the form of my fans. Love comes in many different forms. Right now Im passionately only serving them.,

 Want to have children?, 

 Yes some day. Although my womb is not yet beckoning for a child. ImIm very far away from that day. Im also terrified it will ruin my creativity.,

 Were back with our remaining moments with Lady Gaga. We decided since you were so much in honor of us well have a little in honor of you and go the sun glass route.,

 Oh Larry you are so shady.,

 Look at this. Youre adorable.,

 Shady King.,

 Youve got a number of Facebookweve got a number of Facebook posts posted along the way. Ask Lady Gaga what her next albumwhen is it coming out and what will it be like?,

 Well my next albumit will not be coming out this Christmas which I dont know if I was supposed to tell you but I will tell you so my fans dont crucify me later. But I wanted to give it some time because even though its finished I really want to give my fans what they deserve which is for me to promote and travel the world and give the new music to them in the most perfect and accessible way that I can. And Im on tour right now which means I would have just had to throw the album up against the wall. And it just cheapens the atmosphere which I dont like to do. I like to do things that willI want to go kiss every D.J. and radio director around the world again like I did the first time. So thats the first thing. But the sound isI couldnt possibly give anything away because I dont want to reveal anything. But itsthe album was inspired by my new found understanding and love for my fans aa new found love and understanding for what they need for what they dream about for what they dream for our generation and for the future. And the album for me is an anthem for the new decade. Its ,

 Do ,

 Has an over-arching message.,

 A couple quick things. ,

 Im sorry?,

 Do youI just want to see if I can still see. That was fun. Do youdo you enjoy fame?,

 Do I enjoy fame? I enjoy my fans. My fans are something I could never trade or even dream of giving up. But there are many things that come with it that I perhaps do not enjoy. You know at the end of the day I would much rather not go to the Hollywood party. I would much rather go to the pub around the corner and buy everyone a drink. So ,

 Well ,

 So I just still do. And I can buy you a drink when I come see you in New York.,

 Youve got it. Lets get together soon OK?,

 Yes. We will. We will.,

 The King and the lady.,

 The King and the lady. That sounds like a movie.,

 What a special edition of larry king live we have for you tonight. Its the eve of our 25th anniversary.,

 Wow.,

 Because we started backyes 25 years ago the longest running show. It feels like forever.,

 Yes.,

 And whos here with us but Mick Jagger.,

 Hi there.,

 One of our top requests of all time. Hes finally made it. Today is the day of the release of the Stones album Exile on Main Street. Never-before-heard tracks. This is an amazing release. At the same time it coincides with an amazing documentary called Stones in Exile. Were going to talk about all those things and show you some little clips. This is a big re-release. But first ,

 Big. Yes.,

 Frank Sinatra said to me once. Theres a lot to be said for longevity. ,

 Well youve got no options really.,

 Thats right.,

 Either youre dead or youre longevity.,

 How do you account for the longevity of the Stones as a success?,

 Well I think the Stones are very lucky. You always need a lot of luck. And I think they were in the right place at the right time. And weyou know quite when we work we work very hard. So I thinkso you need all those things. You know theres no good just being hard-working because lots of people are hard-working. But youve got to be hard-working on your game and be lucky.,

 How about staying there though?,

 Staying there yes. Well it requires a certain you know tactics. Its likeits like being a football player or something you know. If youre going to beif youre going to last youve got to play you know a bit clever. You know when youre young you can just rush everything. And then as you get older youve got to be a bit morebox a bit more clever. And Im changing my sporting metaphors. Speakingyou know what I mean so ,

 A lot goes into it?,

 Yes a lot. Yes a lot goes into it. And you know if youre going to do a tour or something thats a lot of work. And you know you have to beyou have to pay attention to the big picture the big picture has to be right. You know the overall has to be right and also the details have to be right.,

 But dont eliminate the word luck.,

 No Im not eliminating luck. Theres a very bigbecause we all know everyone thats been inyou know whatever way of life you know oryoure in you know if you get to be very successful there is usually some point where you just happen to be lucky you know.,

 Right place.,

 That tips it right over into being kind of OK and quite successful into tipping over into beinginto another point you know. ,

 And how do you keep it up all the time? In other words when you get on that stage what keeps it going? What drives ,

 What really keeps it going is the audience. Because if theyou know you feed from the audience and their enthusiasm. And if you have an enthusiastic audience you feel that you know you can give more. You know so I can getI guess its going back to the sporting metaphor. Any guyswhen you feel young you feel reallyyou feel like you have a bad day. And you feel you got a bit of a cold but as soon as you go out there ,

 They drive you.,

 They drive you you know and you usually dont have any problems.,

 But when you started you didnt have the audience because you were new.,

 No thats wellwe had our little audience. You know when we started off playing we were used to playing you know everyone else. We used to play ,

 Clubs?,

 Small clubs. But we had a super enthusiastic club audience. And that kind ofthat audience really taught us how to behave how to have you know reparte with the audience and soand even from those early days its not really than different to the exchange you get with the big audience.,

 Now lets get into this album Exile on Main Street. Whatthe decision to rerelease now.,

 Yes.,

 How did that come about?,

 Well wethere is a record label that bought all our catalog stuff called Universal Records. And they wanted to do something a bit different to mark this you know to put out these albums again. So they picked Exile as being one of the most famous. And they said well will you kind of do somethingyou know will you try and find time to re-master it and also is there any tracks that you didnt release at the time and can you do something special? And I said no there is no tracks there is nothing. Its all done you know. It was a double album. Theres nothing there. But then I went in and I thought well I dont know. No I really dont know if there is anything. So I went in and Keith and I looked andI looked and Dom was our producer and we looked at all these tracks. And some of them were sent by people that thought they were like Stones experts. And I looked at them I said this doesnt sound like Exile. Some of them were not in the time of Exile at all. So I just sort of define the time of what I thought Exile was. Because Exile wasnt recorded in a month. It was recorder over a three-year period. So I took this three-year period and found tracks that were recorded in that three-year period. And some of them the alternate takes which I left as they are and some tracks didnt have any songs them any vocals so ,

 And nothing new?,

 New in what way?,

 New recording for the album?,

 Yes I mean I didsome of them had no vocals on them.,

 Oh you added vocals?,

 They had no song no vocals no words no music just tracks which were really good. Some of the tracks were all done and perfect. Except I wasnt on them. So I thought well OK so Im going to do mine. So I wrote words and I wrote melodies and sang them on some.,

 Are you a perfectionist?,

 Maybe. I am in some things. I mean always know there is only so far you can go you know in this kind of endeavor. You know you got toits good you haveI like a deadline because then after the deadline you know youre done. And thats ,

 Got to be there.,

 You got to be there. And you know because you can mess with this stuff. And some people in you know all kinds of artistic endeavors you know writing books or making movies or records that people love the process of it. They love the process of being in the studio or editing the movie. And so someone at some point says I think youre done now. I think youre finished. What youve got is good enough.,

 Lets talk about the exile. You had a tax lien. You know people forget this story.,

 Yes its not particularly interesting except to us.,

 When a major group leaves?,

 Well yes where we had to go which is sort ofwe had some problems that wewe had some very bad advice. And we were you know pretty green in some ways. And we were just interested in making music and we werent really interested in the money side of things too much. A very typical story.,

 That wasnt the goal?,

 Money wasnt the goal. We expected to be well-off you know because in those days you just did if you were successful. And were very successful but we werent very well managed. So we had to leave England to acquire enough money to pay the taxes. Because in those days in England the high tax rate was 90 percent soThats very hard.,

 You made 100 pounds they took 90?,

 Exactly. You made 100 pounds they took 90. So it was very difficult to pay any debts back. So when we left the country we would get more than the 10 pounds out of the 100. We might get 50 or something.,

 What was it like to live in France? The documentary shows it.,

 Yes. The documentary it wasyou know France is a niceyou know I knew France quite well. And you know most English people have been to France when theyre kids. You know its like the next-door country. And most English people have got experience of France. And then the south of France is pretty ,

 Not bad?,

 Not bad. You know most people love it. You know and Somerset Maugham said you knowhas a saying its a sunny place for shady people. So you know it has an underbelly you know as well. As well as the exotic glamorous exterior. But it wasntyes its a good place. Beautiful climate.,

 Wasnt it hard thoughwasnt it hard to leave home?,

 Its hard yes. I think at the beginning when youre young its not you know. Its not really. I didnt find it much of a wrench. But then after a while you know you realize that you know I mean I didnt miss the British food and all that. But some English people miss other things. But after a while you realize that youit makes you a bit rootless or something and ,

 Ruthless?,

 Rootless.,

 Yes rootless. Yes.,

 Rootless. Yes. But you know having said that if youre a touring musician you tendthats where you tend to be.,

 The road?,

 Itsthe road is your life. And so its notin a way you know you can overplay that.,

 Were you held in low regard in your mother country for leaving it?,

 Oh probably everyone is. I mean everybody thatI mean youre already held in low regard in most countries if you even step out of it ever. You know what people want you to be is a little band that plays in clubs and thats where you should belong. They dont want you to be a big success. Youre never the same. So especially in England in those days. And even now I think that youonce you become a success a worldwide success you no longer belong to the little place where you started to the little part of west London where you were brought up. Soor played. And so you lose something of that when you become a success. I dont think Americas really like that. I think you find that kind of hard to understand.,

 Yes. Success is resented?,

 Yes. Its resented. It was then anyway. Im not sure about now whether it really is on the same level. England is a much more open place.,

 You only had one law problem right? A marijuana thing that you werent convicted. Right? You were never convicted?,

 I think I was. It was a long time ago. I think I wasevery time I come to the United States I still have to sort of go to the special place.,

 Really?,

 Yes yes even though its 40-something years ago. The marijuana conviction yes.,

 Really?,

 I have to go into a room.,

 You have to report?,

 Well you goyou cant go throughyou know the immigration line?,

 Yes.,

 So sometimes if there is someone that knows something about how to deal with it they can do it. But normally I have to go to a special room.,

 Lenny Bruce once said it will be legal some day because every law student I know smokes it.,

 Yes. That never happened.,

 No.,

 Well it sort of half-happened doesnt it in the ,

 Should it be legal?,

 You know its legal to grow.,

 Do you think it should?,

 Well the whole question of legalizing drugs is fraught withsomeone asked me this the other day. And I said you know theI dont know if I got into trouble so maybe I think but you know you usually try these things out in very small places. You know like so you try this inyou know like you try a new product out you know in a small kind of society or an island somewhere. And in England they always try out new mobile phones in isle of man. Theyve got a captive society. So I said you should tryyou should try the legalization of all drugs on the isle of man and see what happens.,

 Do you think it will ever happen? Ever is a long time.,

 Ever is a long time. Peopleyou know there is certainly ahuman beings seem to have a propensity to want to take drugs in some form you know.,

 Makes you feel good.,

 Thousands of years people have taken drugs whether its alcohol which was invented about 5000 years ago. People have been using that. And all kinds of marijuana and all these things tobacco. I dont know how many thousands of years. A long time Im sure. And so all these drugs you know have beenit seems to be the propensity of human beings to want to use them. So you have toI think you have to take that as red you know. But then what do you do when it affects so many peoples lives and not in a good way you know. And then also then you get a lot of violence at both ends of the scope. So you get violence in some countries producing country violence. And then you getwhich like we have in Mexico now and you get violence at the other end of people trying to obtain drugs. So youve got that part of it isthats the part that speaks to some sort of legalization. Because that you would hope would help the violence from both ends of the supply line.,

 When it was in the group and it was famously reported about Keith Richards and the like did it ever affect your performance?,

 Probably.,

 You dont remember?,

 No butno but you dontI dontpersonally you know like performing taking drugs. I always think its better to be not taking drugs or drinking or anything. Thats not saying Ive never done it because I have. But I sort of learned I think after a while there has beenit didnt take me that long to realize that it wasnt a good thing. You know taking drugs on a recreation level is one thing. But taking them while youre working on a stage is you know I dont think it was that great.,

 A control?,

 Its the control factor. And the thing about being on stage you really want to feel that youre sort of in control a lot I think because I dont think you wantits not a place where you want to be out of control.,

 Back to the album.,

 Yes.,

 You recorded overand you recorded in weird places right?,

 Well not so much. No. We got ,

 Downstairs.,

 In the basement in this house that Keith rented in the south of France.,

 What was that like?,

 A lot of it wasit was ayou know it was wonderful. No it was a collection of Warren-like basement rooms you know like a ,

 How could you get good acoustics?,

 Well it wasnt very good acoustics. We spent a long while getting that right. Once we got it right it was good. The beginning was ,

 Why not a studio?,

 In the south of France where we were there werent any studios.,

 So you had ,

 We had to create a studio. Weve done recording like this before. We had our own recording truck. We had you know like a mobile recording truck. And wed recorded before in this fashion. So it wasnt really that much of a stretch. But there was problems you know. It was damp and it was ,

 Isnt three years a long time?,

 We werent there for three years. Were only there for like six seven months..,

 With modern techniques now its incredible what you can do right?,

 Yes would bewouldnt bewouldnt need a truck. And thenso that you know how we did it now is we just have a board and a room and you wouldnt need so much ,

 How is the sound on the re-release?  Well I just remastered the old tracks. So they sound very similar to what they sounded before. And the new tracks I think when we mix them weyou know we mix them with the same kind of spirit. And so they sound very much part of theof the new tunes you put in.,

 Yes.,

 Can you describeand youre very good at thiswhat it is like to hear a piece or read a piece of music and say yes?,

 Thats a good feeling when it all comes together. You know so there was a trackthere is a track on this called Following the River which is a ballad. It has got a beautiful piano part in it which I didnt play. And I had heard this before but it didnt have any lyrics on it at all. And it had a beautifulI could hear different melodies but I didnt know how I was going to get the melody to fit with this already-existing track which is very heavily piano. And when it came together when I sort ofI was just singing along to it. I put it on stereo and I was singing along trying to come up with melody lines and trying different stuff different words. And when it actually came together it was a very good moment you know? Its ,

 There is a moment.,

 There is a moment. And you gothere is a build-up of this you know and then try try try try and then theres a moment where it really comes together for you.,

 When you watch this documentary which as I told you before we went on is extraordinary in that its not like any other documentaryits going toit comes in DVD right?,

 Yes its going to be a DVD coming out in June I think.,

 When you watch it is ithow do you react to watching it? Because its very unusually done. There is no narrator.,

 There is nono there is no narrator. When we started off talking about this with the director and I said thatand I discussed it with him and he you know totally into the same thinghe goes I wanted thatthe audience to feel that they were in 1972. I didnt want them to feel that it was me and Keith sitting in armchairs and sayingyou know showing the guitars that they were played on. And Ive seen many of these kind of documentaries. They sort of have a formula. So I said well I want the viewer to feel that hes there he or she is in that time frame as much as possible. So we usedin the end it must be 90 percent of footage from the time and a tiny bit from now. And the way it sort ofthose two things fit together I think makes it forI mean you dontyou do kind of get the vibe of the time.,

 Its great to have both come out the documentary and the album come out.,

 Yes. Yes yes.,

 How did you pick the name?,

 How did we pick the name? God thats lost in the mists of time. It was from a famous blues song by Muddy Waters called Rolling Stone Blues. Muddy Waters was one of our great heroes.,

 Oh Im sure.,

 And a famous blues singer. And we used to do some of his songs and everything. And so we took the name from him.,

 Did critics pan this album initially?,

 I dont think they panned it no. I think it got sort of mixed reviews.,

 How do you react to reviews?,

 Well ,

 I mean when youre this famous does it matter?,

 I think it does matter. I mean I think see there are some reviewers that you kind of respect to some extent. You know there are some reviewers that just write rubbish and you know you can discount them. But then you want theyou kind of wantwhen you put out a piece of work you want to have the approval ofyou want your own self-approval first. You want to feel that ,

 You like it.,

 Yes. Id like it. And the rest of the musicians band whatever you have to like it. Everyone has to like it. And then your friends have to like it. You know you play it to your friends first. You know you play it. And your peer group has to like it. And you want themyou want their peer group approval. I mean yes you can always say ah well I dont care if he doesnt like it. But you wantand then you wantyou want the public to like it and you want the critics to like it. You want everyone to like it. So it can work on many levels. You know so you can be very happy with the album but no one else likes it. Its notthats a success but its a big success if you get all of those groups liking it. And somethingyou cant have all of those things happen but youso of course everyone wants critical approval. You cant get 100 percent. There are alwaysevery critic is going to say...,

 Have you ever had a critic ,

bad things about you.,

 Ever have a critic help you? Did you ever have a critic write something where you say you know good point?,

 Yes I mean I think sometimes inyou know they do have points you know that theyI mean sometimes. And its very subjective. Its what he wants to hear isnt it? Or she would have liked it to sound like...,

 Its very subjective.,

 You know its very subjective. So they wanted to hear something rougher or they want to hear something smoother or they want to hear more sort of smoochy or they want to hear somewhatever more danceable. So its all very subjective. But I mean you wantyou know theyre going to say its really going toon one hand its really good but on another hand it isnt. You know they always say that critics really. They cant love it or ,

 What groups or individuals affected you as a youngster? Did someone have an impact?,

 Lots of people had impact. You know living in England it wasnt quite as easy to assimilate the kind of music that I loved.,

 Were there American stars you ,

 There were American stars that would visit occasionally. You know and youd have to really be on the ball to know when they were coming and so on or youand there was no Internet to you know find out and so on. And youd have to ,

 Who did you like?,

 I likedwell one of the early visitors a lot to England was called Big Bill Broonzy and he was a blues singer with a kind of veryyou know he used to play a 12-string as well. There was Leadbelly who used to visit. They used to play on the TVon nationwide TV. So that was kind ofyou know something you probably didnt see in America very often.,

 Did the guitarists have a great effect on you?,

 Yes. Those guitarists you know Muddy Waters had a big effect more rock people more like Little Richard and some Buddy Holly. Elvis of course was ,

 What was Buddy Hollys...,

 Buddy Holly was very popular with all of theseevery English person you talked to from my generation at least would always tell you that Buddy Holly was a bighe was a big influence as a songwriter I think because he wrotewhen he was ,

 Melodically.,

 Yes melodically. And he wrote all of these songs in a very short period of time. And theyre all very simple. Theyreall the chord structures ,

 Very.,

are very simple. Theres nothing.,

 Peggy Sue.,

 Yes all of these things. And he was very big in England. And I think he toured only once. I saw him on stage. But he was a very big influence. I mean Paul McCartney bought the catalog,

 Were the Beatles rivals? How did you view them?,

 They were both rivals and they were alsohow do youwhat was a good word to choose? I mean they were also showing the way because they were the first of this kind of ,

 So you kind of admired them?,

 Admired them for that because they were sort of trailblazers in a lot of ways. And you know they went to the United States first. You know they showed the way. They were big international stars. They showedbecause in England most English people have never really been stars outside of England. It would be that you had your little patch and that was it. And the Beatles kind of showed that you could be big internationally.,

 Whats Jimmy Fallon got to do with Mick Jagger? A lot. Watch this.,

 What else you got? Well pointing fingers pointing fingers.,

 Explain that.,

 Jimmy Fallon ,

 Explain it to a logical person.,

 Well what you mean with what were doing?,

 He does you right?,

 Oh he does me? Well lots of people do me. Jimmy does his version of me which of course is nothing like me. But Jimmy does a funny version of me. Weve done a couple of sketches on Saturday Night Live together. And Jimmy this week is doing a week of Exile on Main Street. And at the end of the week on Friday theyre going to show part of the documentary film that we were talking about earlier.,

 Do you ever have the feeling of when you make it that tonight will be easy? I mean were the Stones.,

 No no no. You never think that. You know that. You never thinkthere is never tonight is going to be easy.,

 Never?,

 No no. No.,

 He told me he got that right before he went on stage there was that little bump you know am I going to have it tonight? Is it going to work tonight?,

 I dont really feel like that. But you just feel like youre going to go out and slay them basically. You know thats how I feel. OK you know you say OK Im going to go out and kill the audience and this is it.,

 But you dont feel you have it made?,

 No no no. No thats dangerous. You dont ever feel that youve got it made. You know you can hear if the audience is very enthusiastic very loud super noisy you know youve gotyou know well they seem to be on our side as something you know they sound awfully quiet you know. You know I have to work this you know youyou know what I mean?,

 Yes. ,

 And its always good to go andits always to go and look at the audience while the opening act is on too.,

 On this album...,

 Yes.,

 Where do you rank it among all of your works?,

 Oh my goodness. I dont know really. Its one of the real good ones. And its a real favorite of people. And we do play a lot on stage of this album. So you know I rank it right up there.,

 Special?,

 A special album for me.,

 And thehow many additional tunes have been added?,

 Eleven. Some of them are alternate takes but there are six that havent been released before yes. I think theyre all good. Of course I do.,

 We have been together many many times over the years. Do you ever look back and say Im not the guy that I was?,

 All the time all the time. Yeah. Its pretty interesting that you said that. I look at that guy and say what was going on? Who was happening there? You have no idea what was going on with my life back then with this guy. What was going on back then?,

 What the most changed you?,

 I dont know. I had to grow up. I had an incident where I lost my daughter in some family accident at home and it was just a time to grow up and wake up.,

 That was of course the worst incident in your life right?,

 Pretty much pretty much. Yeah.,

 She died how?,

 A freak accident on the treadmill.,

 How old was she?,

 Four.,

 Were you home?,

 No. I wasnt living with her mother at the time. I was in Las Vegas and they lived in Phoenix. And her mother called me and told me what happened. I rushed down there and it was already pretty much a done deal.,

 How do youyou never get over that do you?,

 I dont know. I dont know. Its a new stage. Its the beginning stage. So I dont know if I get over it or not.,

 Do you believe in an afterlife? Do you believe that she is somewhere?,

 I dont know anything. I just know that we have to keep on living and being alive is for the living and being dead is for the dying. We have to continue living you know.,

 Thats an interesting philosophy on life. You are done with boxing right?,

 Pretty much yeah.,

 You dont ever think about doing a Holyfield?,

 Never ever. I wish I couldIm envious that he does it but I wish I could.,

 Do you ever miss it?,

 Periodically. Not I should have done this but every now and then.,

 You dont go through would have should have could have?,

 Never.,

 The career the life and times of Mike Tyson an extraordinary figure in the history of American sport the former heavyweight boxing champion. Lets go back a little. Do you think you had too much too soon?,

 I dont know Larry. I wanted it I dont know if I was prepared for it but I know I wanted it. I was prepared to get it. I trained hard and worked hard you know.,

 How old were you when you were a champion?,

 20-years-old.,

 In reflection would you have been better off if it had happened when you were 25?,

 No because then I would have been obsolete. I would have just been like everyone else.,

 So youre glad that youre the youngest person to hold the title?,

 Yes.,

 You grew up in a tough neighborhood in Brooklyn.,

 You did too.,

 Same neighborhood Brownsville.,

 Isnt that an awesome place?,

 Saratoga Park did you used to go there?,

 All the time.,

 My dad used to take me there for Good Humor ice cream. You had to bust out of that neighborhood?,

 Yes of course you know it was a tough inner city probably the toughest in America the poorest city in America. And its just a world of dog eat dog. Of course its where Murder Incorporated originated from.,

 You know your history.,

 Yeah.,

 You have Brooklyn still in you though?,

 Until the day I die yes.,

 Me too.,

 Its just who you are. Theres something about Brooklyn people and its interesting because every one of us always feel different. For some reason if we feel like were from Brooklyn we will like were the best. Dont you feel the same way too?,

 Not the best. Certainly were apart.,

 Yeah. People are going to know our name and know where we came from. You feel the same way too.,

 Yeah. A lot of success stories out of Brooklyn.,

 Exactly 100 percent.,

 Maybe its because were like an island. Manhattan was out there right?,

 I would say so yeah.,

 Do you still have friends from Brooklyn?,

 Yeah I do. And you know its going to be interesting because this new documentary series that Im a part of into the world of pigeon flying and bird racing so youre going to see some of my friends that I grew up when I was a little kid and we grew up flying pigeons together when we were 10 and 11-years-old and were still flying pigeons now. So its ironic how we interact its not the Mike Tyson that youre used to seeing. Its not like Mike Tyson and his entourage its like get that fing bird get this watch out move down. Its just really interesting.,

 I remember Brando flew pigeons in a movie.,

 On the waterfront.,

 He flew pigeons. What took you to flying pigeons?,

 I dont know. Its someI was probably 10 or 11- years-old. And I was flying some birdssome friends of mine had skipped school and I had skipped school too because some guys were picking on me all the time so I didnt want to go to school. So these other guys saw me and said come here. You have any money? I was a frightened and scared kid and they packed my pocket and they said you want to fly with us? I didnt know what fly meant. I said yeah Im a dope. So they made me climb the fence and I had to get those crate boxes you know in the school they had those crate boxes so I threw a few of the crate boxes over and we went to this abandoned building at St. Marks all right. And we went there and Im getting creeped out like why are we in this building with these guys? This is little kids theyre older than me. And we go on the roof and I see a little coup raggedy coup and I see some pigeons and Im like wow. And so these birds that these guys had they were really ill conditioned birds. They were horrible birds. They couldnt fly 100 feet but every time they would fly they would land on the building so these guys would make me a gopher they would make me chasego on the abandoned building chase the birds off that building say go to another building and go to a corporate building and I had to go to a building.,

 They didnt fly back?,

 No. They were just so lazy. They had rotten birds.,

 So you got to like it?,

 Yeah.,

 Why?,

 I dont know. I really wish I could tell you. Its like ,

 Do you have birds now?,

 Birds in my house. Well all together I have birds everywhere that I journey I have homes that I live hang out I have birds there. So all together I have probably around 2500 birds.,

 OK Mike you dont think thats a little weird?,

 Well in different places. I dont know. Its always a problem.,

 When you have pigeons do they fly and come back to you?,

 Yeah.,

 Are they like trained?,

 Sometimes they fly 500 miles you take them 500 miles and they come back. Thats just the pigeon world. Its very difficult to explain to a person.,

 Theres so many inconsistencies in you Mike. I guess you wonder about it yourself. You find Allah. At the same time you get yourself in trouble over the years youve got trouble with drugs with the law with the paparazzi financial problems. Are there two Mike Tysons?,

 I dont know if theres two Mike Tysons but everyone knows who cares who you are the richest person in the world the poorest person in the world hard times fall upon everyone. And regardless of what kind of religion you could be a Christian a Muslim a Jew atheist whatever you are whoever we are whatever we have with us we bring our baggage to us to our religion with us regardless of who we are we just have baggage that we have and we bring it with us. And until we work on the problem that is an inside job were going to still be reckless and continue to get into a lot of trouble.,

 Shouldnt your faith have helped you not get in trouble?,

 I dont know. I dont know if faith can help me. I have to help me. I have to help me. You know what I mean? God dont help anyone that doesnt help themselves. So I have to help me.,

 Do you remember what attracted you or maybe this is hardest thing to explain to drugs in the first place? I know you defeated it.,

 I like to believe that because I was born an addict. My mother was an addict. So I am who I am. I love who I am and embrace who I am. And thats just who it is.,

 Were you addicted when you were boxing? ,

 Ive always been addicted. Ive always been addicted. I wasnt using drugs when I was boxing when I started. But it was so interesting. And then I said why I didnt do drugs for 14 years but I never considered alcohol is a drug too. But I would get drunk after every fight. I said Im off drugs 14 years but really I wasnt. So that wasnt really true. I was just lying to myself. I would get drunk after every fight just blasted.,

 Do you still consider yourself an addict?,

 Yeah.,

 How long sober?,

 Probably 18 months.,

 See if you were born an addict your mother an addict that can happen at birth.,

 I dont use that for no excuse because if I used that for an excuse theres no way could I ever accomplish what Ive accomplished you know. You cant help who you are what you are but you can sure help your conduct.,

 How do you avoid temptation?,

 I have responsibilities in my life. I dont want to let my children down anymore. I dont want to let myself down I dont want to let my wife down anymore. And I have a lot of things to do in a very short time.,

 I guess the former heavyweight champion and one of myhes aMike Tyson hes an unusual guy. He has a new show coming out next year on Animal Planet.,

 Thank you very much Larry.,

 Its calledI dont want to offend you.,

 Never.,

 Who is with you?,

 Thats my friend Mario. He also is one of the co-hosts on the show that were having.,

 Do we see pigeons flying in that show?,

 Absolutely.,

 When you have a pigeon race do they have numbers on them?,

 Of course. They have bands and you have the bands identify them and everyone gets their team of birds maybe 30 guys 100 guysit depends.,

 Where do they race?,

 It depends on the duration lets take them 1000 miles lets them 100 miles lets take them 70 miles it depends.,

 Wait a minute. OK theyre going to race 100. Do they race from L.A. to Vegas?,

 Im sure yes.,

 How do you know who won?,

 As soon as they come back the bird gets in you clock the time. You clock the time it gets in and you cant cheat because the time is on the computer and then we all wait until ,

 How fast do they fly?,

 Sixty miles-an-hour.,

 Whoa. Thats pretty fast. You cant make money from this?,

 Yes you can this is big money. ,

 How?,

 But were not doing it for money. Were doing it for bragging rights.,

 How do you make money from pigeon racing?,

 Its one of the biggest sports in the world yes everyone does that.,

 Are you betting each other?,

 Different clubs bet each other.,

 This was a new world to me.,

 No this was before Christ.,

 Do you name your pigeons?,

 No.,

 I know you had a bad temper. I remember that phase of you. Do you still have it?,

 Well not really but Im sure you can get it out if you look deep enough.,

 I mean do little things set you off?,

 Not as much as they used to no. How about you?,

 No Ill get it but it goes right away. Ive never held a grudge.,

 I wish I could say that.,

 You hold grudges?,

 No Ive held some I havent had any to hold lately but I have held some before.,

 When you were in the ring you wereIve had the good fortune of interviewing many many boxers many heavyweight champions. And Rocky Marciano told me he would have rather been a baseball player. He never really liked it. He was good at it but he never liked it and he didnt like the killer instinct. He had to have it. It was in the ring. But he never enjoyed it really enjoyed it. You enjoyed it didnt you?,

 Well you know its funny you say that. In order to accomplish all of the goals that DAmato put in front of me I had to view myself greater than what I truly was. So I had to really get into a character be this unstoppable invincible monster and thats just what it was.,

 So was your manager DAmato trainer DAmato forcing you into that?,

 No but I wanted to make him happy. He was like my father figure. I wanted to make him happy I wanted to be the ferocious champion that was invincible.,

 What was it like to hit someone hard?,

 You know Larry when youre fighting actually in the ring in the ring youre talking about right?,

 Yeah for you it could be anywhere but Im talking about in the ring.,

 I dont know. You practice it most of your life and then you accomplish it in the ring and you work for it. You anticipated it you expected it. You dont get a big joy out of it. You expect it to happen. If it doesnt happen then you have a disappointment moment.,

 Do you ever feel sorry for an opponent?,

 I dont think so no. It was either him or me at that time. I could have all the admiration and respect for him but its either me or him at that time.,

 Ali told me once hey all of these poems and everything that guy is trying to hurt me.,

 Yeah but we cant look at it like this. This is a job. No one put a gun to our heads and made us do this. This is a job. head. Its more of an art. If youre doing your art correctly youre not going to get hurt.,

 Were back with Mike Tyson. Do you still train? Do you keep in shape?,

 Yeah yeah I do basically two hours a day. So the treadmill or the bike hour on the treadmill hour on the bike may walk two hours. And thats all I do light weights.,

 Do you go to fights?,

 Sometimes.,

 Do you like watching boxing?,

 Sometimes sometimes.,

 Youre not a big fan?,

 I like being entertained. If its MMA if its boxing if its a movie I just want to be to be entertained. I want somebody to entertain me because thats what I like to do. I like to entertain people so I want to be entertained too. So if Im not being entertained I dont go. Theres not too many entertaining fighters not too many entertaining heavyweights in the boxing world. Theyre good fighters just not entertaining. People get the two confused a guy being a confident fighter rather than being an exciting fighter.,

 Ali.,

 Yes.,

 You were both.,

 Thank you.,

 You could go on a quiz show with the subject of boxing. You know your history right?,

 At one time I did I knew a little bit yes.,

 You used to name all the champions the years of the champions who beat who.,

 Because that was my profession. I wanted to be the best at it so I wanted to know the whole history of their stuff. I was just crazy about this boxing stuff.,

 What do you remember most about that terrible night in Tokyo where Buster Douglas beat you biggest upset of all that night?,

 I dont know. I just remember he fought good that night. He really fought good.,

 You werent trained well?,

 Well I could have been better trained but the fact is he fought great. That really set off everything.,

 Did you know early on you were in trouble?,

 Yes yes I did.,

 What told you?,

 When I couldnt hit him.,

 That must have been a pretty good sign frustrating. Most of the guys that you fought were taller than you right?,

 Pretty much yes.,

 People didnt realize that.,

 Im pretty short Im 510. Im not a tall person.,

 Yes but these guyswould you have liked to have fought Ali?, 

 No no I dont want to fight Ali. Thats one of my heroes. I wouldnt want to fight those guys. I like the way history made all of these guys I watched before me Dempsey Ali Tunney.,

 Lewis?,

 Lewis yes. Marciano. I just watched those guys and I said man Im glad that I watched them before me you know I mean because if I didnt have those guys to watch and study theres no way I would have been successful in this stuff.,

 When you see Muhammad Ali now and you see what the disease has done to him do you ever fear of something slowing you down as you age?,

 I dont know. Theres not much that Im afraid of basically in life you know? Because when you think about it the worst thing that ever happened to me I lostI lost one of my kids. So what am I afraid of?,

 You cant top that no.,

 Yes tell me about it. So no I dont think Im afraid of anything.,

 Why do you live in Las Vegas?,

 Because Ive lived forIve lived for probably 24 years25 years. Thats just so long.,

 What do you like about it the most?,

 Its just who I am. Its where Imyou know what I mean? I know everybody there. Its justits notlike my home now.,

 Is it hot in the summer?,

 Yes Im used to that stuff.,

 A Brooklyn kid you know.,

 Yes but thats OK. I can handle it. Thats a Brooklyn kid. We can endure anything.,

 OK. All right. By the way do you think you deserve to be in the Boxing Hall of Fame?,

 I dont know. Thats not up to me to decide you know? Let the people vote and decide whether I should be in the Hall of Fame or not you know?,

 Do you think you should be?,

 I dont know. I cantif I ever allow my will to run riot Ill sayI think I deserve to be a God but I wont because I will never say that. But I just think you know I cant say anything do I deserve anything because of course everybody in their own belief want to be the best in the world at what their endeavors were. Thats what they want to be.,

 I sat with you in the ring in Las Vegas the eve of your comeback fight. You just got out of prison. BoxingI asked you if it was a tough way to make a living. You didnt want to answer and then you said I dont want to be a harlot to this sport. Im not going to say something against it. Do you still feel that way?,

 I dont know. I owe boxing a lot. So I dont really have nothing derogatory to say about it.,

 Does it owe you anything?,

 Well I dont want anything from it.,

 You made a lot of money from it?,

 Well thats great you know? But boxingIm not bigger than boxing. You know what I mean? I wish I was. Not one individual fighter is bigger than boxing. You know what I mean?,

 We are back with the legendary Mike Tyson. I asked the aforementioned Rocky Marciano once if he was ever afraid of anyone. And he said when he was a kid he was bullied and there was a bully on the block that he was afraid of. Did you ever have anybody you were afraid of?,

 Im afraid of tons of people I guess.,

 When you were a kid?,

 When I was a kid yes. You know its easy to be bullied because you never fought before and you dont if youre going to win. You dont have the confidence you know? Confidence is everything. Confidence breeds success. Success breeds confidence. Without confidence you just dont go nowhere.,

 Did you have fights as a kid?,

 Yes but I wasnt that successful. You know what I mean? They some of the stories make it like I was beating everybody up in the streets. No I wasnt that successful.,

 Did kids beat you up?,

 Yes yes.,

after you won the championships sitting around with friends saying you know I beat him up once?,

 Wow.,

 Do you ever run into some later on?,

 No never.,

 Youd have a tough time. What do you make of all this bullying going on today?,

 I dont know. Its just a different world from when I was a little kid. Its a different world.,

 I mean do you know why people bully people? Ive never understood it.,

 I dont know. People bully people because they were bullied. Thats just the way it goes. The abuser becomes the abusee. And thats just how it goes right?,

 Yes but bullying people because theyre gay or because theyre different from you or because theyre black.,

 Well I dont know. We dont know who we are. Some people dont understand themselves. How do we understandits difficult to understand people in society now? People just dont want to get along. You ever think racism is at a all-time high. People ,

 Well we got a black president.,

 Yes butall right. Thats awesome. But you know people want to feel different. You know what I mean? We have a black president but people want to feel the change that he actuallythat were fighting for.,

 Its never going to end then. Or do you think it will? Do you think it will everno it will never end.,

 What?,

 Racism.,

 I dont know. Everyone always has something to be Pd off about I guess.,

 You got to feel better than somebody. You were trying to help a young boy with aplastic anemia.,

 Yes.,

 What is that? Hes an eight-year-old kid. ,

 Yes and he continues to have thesehes like my nephew in a way. You know me and his father me and his uncle are very tight. Were going to be on the pigeon show too. Theyre pigeon flyers with me.,

 No they live in Jersey City.,

 So how did you meet the kid?,

 Well I knew himI knew his parents before he was born and we flew pigeons ever since we were all littlethey were little ,

 Yes.,

 Have people offered? Have people tried?,

 Yes we hadwe hadI believe a month ago we had a rally and we had like 600 people came out because its very rare in the African-American and Spanish community that we get any donors.,

 Youre just gone?,

 Yes. You dont feel anything.,

 Thank you Mike.,

 Yes youre welcome Larry.,

 You kept a diary and now you reveal it?,

 Well I thought Id wait 30 years and do it.,

 Why wait?,

 Well it was highly personal. When I wrote it I never thought I would let it be published. But I re-read it a few years ago and I saw that there were so many things that are pertinent today the same issues that I faced that Obama is having to face today. And also I thought it was good to have somewhere on the historical record just the actual day by day thoughts and dreams and ideas and failures and successes and impressions of other people that are still quite fresh in peoples minds. So those are the main things I wanted to point out.

 Were you before the presidency a diary keeper?,

 No I never did. As a matter of fact the first time I thought about doing a diary was when I was governor. And we went up to the White House to the governors conference. And we met Richard Nixon who was the first president I ever met. He was standing there with Billy Graham. And Richard Nixon he kind of ignored me. And he reached over and shook my wifes hand and said young lady are you keeping a diary? She said no I dont. He said well youre a governors wife and you ought to keep a diary. So we talked about it. So when I became president I decided well why dont I keep a diary? So it was really Richard Nixon who talked me into keeping a diary.,

 What a great story. Did you just write it in pen?,

 No I dictated it. I had a small hand held Dictaphone. And so Iwhen I finished up a tape I just threw it in the out basket. I never looked at it again. I put a new tape in. And six or seven times every day I would dictate my latest thoughts about what I was planning what I had succeeded in doing and what my impressions were of people who just left the office. So I tried to put down in my diary things that wouldnt come out in the public print. You know every Friday theres published every word that a president says every question that he answers every statement that he ,

 In public right?,

 In public. So I try to put in my diary things that werent going to be in that public diary. So when I got homeI never looked at it again. But when I got home I had 5000 pages of diary notes that had been typed up. I still have those one of two copies in the world one in my room at home my study and the other one at the Carter Presidential Library. So this is about 20 percent of the total words that are in my original diary.,

 If you go to diary can you read it allif you go to the center?,

 After a yearI think when the paperback of this book comes out Im going to make it available to scholars and news reporters to go to the presidential library and read the original taped original.,

 Im told that if youre a diaristthats what they call themyou must write every day no matter how bad the day.,

 I do that.,

 You did that?,

 I probably wrote more in the bad days than I did the good days because that was more memorable more emotional for me. And I wanted to get down how I felt about things and issues and people more than I did what I actuallyyou know what I actually did and activities. ,

 Were going to have you read onea couple of excerpts from the book. But this is from the Inauguration Day January 20th 1977. We printed it out to make it easier. Good. I think the inauguration speech itself perhaps one of the briefest on record for the first inauguration for president was quite compatible with my announcement speech in December of 1974 and also with my acceptance speech at the Democratic Convention. It accurately expressed some of the major themes of my administration. Even though I had been preparing to be president I was genuinely surprised when the benediction by the bishop of Minnesota referred to blessings on President Carter. Just the phrase President Carter was startling to me. Well you know I had been a peanut farmer. I hadyou know who the first presidentDemocratic president I ever met? Bill Clinton. No kidding.,

 No kidding. I had neverI was just out of the peanut fields. I met NixonPresident Nixonafter I became governor. So I was new at the presidential level. And it was kind of startling to me to be called president.,

 How long does it take to get into the job?,

 Well I had to get into that first day because I had a lot to do when I came off the reviewing stand. You know immediately to make ,

 I remember you walked.,

make official things that I had decided to do. One of the things I did was among the most controversial I ever did. And that was to pardon the so-called draft dodgers who escaped into Canada. And I did that before I ever began to walk down toward the Oval Office.,

 Wow. Did that come up in the campaign that issue?,

 No it never did. No.,

 But you knew you were going to do it?,

 Yes I knew I was going to do it. A lot of people that were families of those men whoand a few women I thinkwho went to Canada and they werethey wanted to come back home. So I just issued a blanket pardon for them. I got some criticism obviously because a lot of folks thought the draft dodgers should be executed for treason and so forth.,

 Its funnynot funny but that you would be here on the opening day of the annual UN opening that your book would be published at the same time and that Iran is always in the news. Were going to be talking to President Ahmadinejad on Wednesday. ,

 All right.,

 And now we have this lady held more than a year on spying charges and Iran says they want eight arrested Iranians released. What do you make of all of this?,

 Well first of all I think we ought to keep maximum communication with leaders and their nations with whom we disagree. And I know that President Obama promised he was going to do that when he went into office. But I think thats important. And I dont knowI dont know what charges are against the eight Iranians. I understand they violated the sanction against Iran somehow or another. But I hope that the two that are still remaining over there her fiance and her friend would be released. I just got back from North Korea. You may know I went over there to get one of our young men from Boston Elijah Gomes who walked across a frozen river from China into North Korea and he was arrested. He was sentenced to eight years in prison and fined 700000 US dollars. So I just got him out. But he made a mistake and he admitted it that he shouldnt have gone into North Korea. So shethey say that they didnt know they were crossing the border.,

 We have the one woman out. Would you go there to try to get the other two? If they asked you?,

 If I was asked to go I would. But you know Im not the most popular person still in Iran soalthough as soon as the Shah fell left Iran against my wishes I immediately established diplomatic relations with the revolutionary government under the Ayatollah Khomeini. So we had full diplomatic relations and full communications. Those were my diplomats over there under the revolutionary government that were captured.,

 Do we take his seriously or not?,

 I think you have to take him seriously because withinas I said within bounds he speaks for the ultimate authorities in Iran when he says something. He couldnt get too far removed from what they want him to say.,

 All right. Do you think Iran today more or less a threat?,

 I think ,

 Are you concerned about them?,

 I am. Yes I am. Because they feel isolated from the western world first of all. And we make constant threats that we are going to bomb them as you know if they dont comply with our wishes on the nuclear proposals. I think theymy own belief is they are planning to make a nuclear weapon a nuclear explosive. They claim they are not. So thats of great concern to me because it will disturb the status quo in the Middle East region.,

 So what do we do though?,

 I would like to see us have more easy communication with them to negotiate directly with them talk to them. Thats what Obama promised before he was president. So far we havent been able to do that effectively. They havent responded very favorably either. So I think communicate with them and stop threatening that were going to attack them because if there are moderate I would say ultimate leaders in the religious circles of Iran who are doubtful about whether or not to have a nuclear weapon the more we threaten them and isolate them from us the more likely they are to go with a nuclear weapon.,

 We have a new health care bill.,

 Yes.,

 First one ever passed in 75 years. And in your book Ted Kennedy is generally perceived as the creator of this or inspired it.,

 Of course. ,

 Here in your book you say the late senator killed health care reform back in 1978. You describe him as having an irresponsible and abusive attitude essentially accusing him of blocking health care out of personal spite.,

 Well you know let me point out once more that that actually was written 31 years ago. And Kennedy ,

 That was your feelings at that time.,

 He was actually running against me for president. I was holding office. He was trying to take my office away from me. And he and five other chairmen of the key committees dealing with health care all worked with me in preparing the proposal that I put forward. And so the other five leaders stayed with me. But at the last minute Ted Kennedy withdrew his support for what he had helped to draft and killed it in effect because he was a powerful and influential senator at f that time. And he washe had two motivations Im guessing now. He didnt want to give me a great success since he hoped to knock me off as president. And secondly I think he saw that if he could kill my bill then maybe later on when he became president which he hoped to do in 1981 then he could put his own bill forward as a much more complete bill.,

 Actually that was written as you said 31 years ago. But his former chief of staff Larry Horowitz called the criticism that you did in the book sad classless clearly embittered. You could have chosen to leave that out.,

 Well you know I didnt leave out anything that I thought was pertinent even though it was very frank and although I had great admiration for Senator Kennedy as one of the most wonderful and successful senators we ever had. And I would say that after I left office he and I became adequately reconciled. He worked very closely with my wife Rose on health legislation and that sort of thing. So we were basically friends after I left office.,

 So its just an honest thats what it was?,

 Thats what happened. Its all in the record. I actually quote the laws that I put forward that would have given catastrophic coverage to everybody in America would add 16 million people that would have complete health insurance. And in four years it would have given comprehensive health coverage to every person in America. And it was killed.,

 Were back with President Jimmy Carter. The White House Diary just published. This is its opening day in a sense. All right Obama signed the health care bill six months ago. What did you think of it? And why are youare you surprised that more Americans oppose it than favor it?,

 Well I was delighted when it passed. I thought it could possibly have been much more aggressive with a single payer simple system. Thats what I personally preferred. But he did the best he could under extremely difficult circumstances with no Republicans helping him. And I think the negative aspect to it is because of the total distortion of the news that Fox broadcasting has perpetrated on the American people when they hammer away day after day after day that his health program will kill old people and things of that kind. A lot of gullible folks in the United States actually believe what Fox puts forward as facts when most of it is just complete distortions. And theyve also attempted to twist around what his religious faith is and whether or not hes an American and so forth. So I think thats a new version of cable news that was not there thank goodness when I was there. But I would attribute most of the negative attitude not to the facts but to the distorted facts that comes out of the Fox.,

 What do make of all this? Tea Party Fox the Glenn Becks of the world? What do you make of this phenomenon in a sense.,

 Well Im very disturbed about it. I cant really criticize the Tea Party people because I came into the White House pretty much on the same basis that they have become popular. That is dissatisfaction with the way things are going in Washington and disillusionment and disencouragement about the government. But thats what happened before I ran for president. Had it not been for that feeling in the country I would not have been elected. For instance we were just out of the embarrassment of Watergate and the defeat in Vietnam and the fact that a lot of people lied about what was going on in Vietnam the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. and both of the Kennedy brothers and the revelation by Frank Church Committee that the United States government and the CIA and some presidents had actually perpetrated murder in other countries. All of that had brought about a feeling among the people that something was wrong in our government. And I think thats whats being utilized by the Tea Party people to arouse animosity.,

 Are you saying alls fair?,

 Well it is fair. My guess is that the Tea Party will be very influential in the upcoming election in the midterm election this coming November. My guess is that theyll soon be absorbed ineach other will absorb the Republican party and the Tea Party movement. So a couple of years from now maybe in 2012 when the presidential election comes on I think the Tea Party will be not a unique startling newcomer on the political scene but all hat stuff.,

 Bill Clinton said the Tea Party supporters have good impulses calls the movement a general revolt against bigness.,

 I think it is a general result against something that many of them dont like yes.,

 How much of it do you think is racist? We have a black president.,

 I dont think the Tea Party people are racist except maybe a tiny portion of them. But there has been a deliberate effortagain referring to Fox Broadcastingto inject the race issue into it. They have actually called Obama a racist on television. And when they say like some of the leaders of the Republican party have said that hes epitomizing the tribal influence of his father from Kenya you know that obviously has political connotations. So I thinkI mean racist connotations. So I think some of it is racist. But I dont blame the Tea Party movement for ,

 What do you make of Gingrichs recent suggestion?,

 I was talking about Gingrich.,

 Kenyan but also anti-colonial.,

 Yes I was talking about Gingrich. I think that Gingrich five years ago would be embarrassed at what Newt Gingrich is saying today and doing today.,

 Why isnt it embarrassing today?,

 I think he has ambitions to be a presidential candidate. And he thinks that to go hard right and to appeal to the extreme even Tea Party movement members may be beneficial to him politically.,

 All right. What is your read on Obama?,

 I think hes a good solid intelligent man who is suffering from perhaps the worst Washington environment of any president in history and I would even include Abraham Lincoln as we led up to the war between the states. No other president has faced such a polarized Congress where he can hardly get one or two votes you know out of hundreds who are Republicans in the House and the Senate. So he has had to overcome that. And I think hes had remarkable success in light of that handicap.,

 Back with former President Jimmy Carter. The occasionthis is book number what?,

 Twenty six.,

 His 26th book White House Diary. an extraordinary account of his years in the presidency in which he kept a daily diary by dictating every day sometimes three four times a day. All right you write extensively of course about the Mideast. I remember great interviews we did about ,

 I remember.,

the summit at Camp David and everything. But most particularly about Camp David and your efforts then. You got a peace treaty that still exists.,

 Thats right. Not a word has been violated in 32 years.,

 Amazing. The only one ever I think between them. What are your expectations of this next go around?,

 I think if anybody can be successful Hillary Clinton is the right one to be the chief negotiator. Shes competent. She knows her background. Shes I think very forceful. And she is determined to prevail. And if she can get any sort of glimmer of accommodation by both sides at the same time I think shell be successful. But I wouldnt bet on it because I know that s intransigence is involved there.,

 How frustrating is it to be a deal maker there?,

 Well its very frustrating. As I wrote in my diary every day I meanI had probably 50 entrieswhat Israel has wanted is to keep the West Bank. And thats the main thing they havent yielded on in 30 years. They gave up the Sinai. They didnt want the Gaza Strip ever. But theyve always wanted to keep the West Bank. So theyve got now control over probably more than 50 percent of the West Bank including all of the Jordan River Valley and multiple settlements as you know between Jerusalem and the Jordan River. So I think thats basically the cause of the problem. And if they would ,

 Israels the cause by keeping it?,

 Well theres faults on both sides but thats the thing that has not changed. Of course the Palestinian issue has changed a lot. They have had three elections. The Carter Center and I have been there for every election. But obviously the unwillingness of the Palestinians to make concessions and to agree to accept Israels existence and right to live in peace is a major factor as well. And the violence on both sides has been a major factor. But the unchanging issue is Israels desire to keep the West Bank.,

 But when Prime Minister Netanyahu was here a little while ago he said he was open to anything. Just lets sit and talk.,

 I pray that thats the case.,

 You dont believe it?,

 I dont know. Well have to see. I dont know. But I think Hillary will give them every chance to make the right concessions to move forward.,

 Youre impressed with her?,

 Yes I am. I met with her the other day when I came back from North Korea with messages from them leading toward de- nuclearization of the peninsula and peace. I enjoyed meeting with her. She was very open minded. She was very inquisitive. She was knowledgeable. I know that she is a competent person who would do the best she can. And I think that she sees that this is her chance to do something that others havent been able to do.,

 What about those on the far left the extremists on both sides who hinder this process?,

 Thats ,

 Bombers you know the suicides.,

 I know. Thats a case on both sides as you say. And I would say that Menachim Begin when he left Camp David had made a much more courageous decision than either Sadat made or I. And that was a major step forward. And of course it led to a complete treaty of peace between Israel and the other Arab countries that challenger them or threaten them you know militarily with whom they had been at war four times in the 25 years before I became president. But Israel didnt carry out the commitments that they made to me and President Sadat about no more settlements and having the West Bank be turned over to the Palestinians. But I have always admired Begin because of that.,

 Do you think you get a bad wrap over the Israeli/Palestinian issue from the Israeli side?,

 Well I lost a major portion of the Israeli political support in 1980 not all of it. I mean but compared to what I had done in 1976 and what other Democratic presidents have done. And a lot of them felt that I took an even-handed stance between Israel and the Palestinians and even-handed is not acceptable to many people. And also I have had severe criticisms from Netanyahu and a few others because I gave away the Sinai Desert from Israel back to Egypt. So thats comprehensible. I am not complaining about it because I can see how people who are completely committed to Israel want to have Israel prevail on every issue.,

 Were back with former President Jimmy Carter. The book is White House Diary. The Obamas wept to church yesterday. Some said only becausehes not basically a church goer. He was back in Chicago but sincebecause hes being tagged as non-Christian. What do you make of that?,

 Well Im glad he went to church. And I dont think it was just that. I think he is a deeply religious person. Hes obviously a Christian. And many presidents have not been to church. Reagan didnt go to church while he was president or before or after as a regular thing although I dont doubt his Christianity. But different people have different approaches. I went to the First Baptist Church every Sunday. If I was at Camp David we had church at Camp David.,

 Are you still a lay preacher?,

 I teach the Bible every Sunday at home.,

 Youve always gone?,

 Yes I have.,

 What do you make of Obama going at this particular time?,

 Im glad he went. I think maybeI dont know his motivation. Maybe he just wanted to worship. Or maybe he wanted to let people be reminded accurately that he is a devout Christian. Its the certain prerogative of any human being including presidents.,

 What keeps your faith with all you see around you?,

 Its aits a basic precise of my moral and practical life. Ive been a Christian all my life since I was three years old and was going to church. My father was a Sunday schoolteacher like I am now. And its been a great solace to me in times of trial and disappointment or sorrow or failure or disillusionment. I prayed more whenthe last year I was in office than I ever have before or since while the hostages were being held. My prayer was never that I would prevail or win or anything but that every hostage would come home safe and free. And my prayers were answered as you know. And so Ive been basically at ease with my faith. And I enjoy each Sunday that Im home about 35 times a year teaching the Bible. I teach half the time in Hebrew text Old Testament and half the time in the New Testament.,

 What do you make of the Islamic center controversy here just a couple mimes from where we are?,

 They ought to build it. They have a perfect right to build it. This is a part of our nations premise freedom of religion. And not only freedom of religion but equality among the religions as far as the preference of worshippers is concerned. I think its gotten a little bit false to say well they have a constitutional right to do it but they cant do it; were not going to let them do it. I think they ought to go ahead and build it.,

 You understand the unrest though?,

 I do. Well let themlet there be some unrest. Its two complete blocks away from so-called holy ground of the disaster in 9/11. And its not an intrusion on any other beliefs. And also its surrounded by I understand strip joints and commercial establishments and so forth. Its just a contrivance in my opinion by people who want to arouse anti-Islamic feelings.,

 What do you make of the presidents handling so far of Afghanistan?,

 Well he inherited the Afghanistan problem. I was involved in the Afghan problem from the beginning. On Christmas day of 1979 the Soviets began to haul in about 12000 troops and they invaded Afghanistan. That was the beginning of the problem. They stayed there about eight years until Gorbachev finally decided to bring them out. And in that time I gave the Afghan freedom fighterswe called themevery possible support I could in a clandestine or secret way. In fact all the weapons that I gave them were soviet weapons that we got from Egypt and from Saudi Arabia and from Pakistan. We didnt use American weapons. And eventually the freedom fighters prevailed. When the Soviets did withdraw Gorbachev did it. I think if we had just gone in then and spent a tenth as much as were spending now on weapons and fighting and rebuilt Afghanistan there would never have been an opening for al Qaeda to go in. So I hope well get out of Afghanistan as soon as possible and maybe work with moderate members of the Talibanand there are many of themand try to have some accommodations with them.,

 Were back with President Carter. The book White House Diary. Colin Powell says that Obama has lost some of his ability to connect with the public that he needs to be like a razor blade and go after the employment issue. Be more forceful.,

 Yeah. Well I dont think theres any doubt that he sapped away a lot of his political popularity concentrating so heavily on getting the health bill passed. And I think a lot of people feel maybe legitimately that if he had concentrated more on jobs jobs jobs instead of anything else he would be more politically popular now. But that was a great achievement for health care. And I think in the long run it is going to be very good for our country. But I believe that what Colin said is accurate. But I dont blame President Obama for having made that choice.,

 It is still a ways away but is he in political trouble in 2012?,

 I think the situation politically is going to be quite different in 2012 from what it is this time. I think in 2010 the midterm elections the Democrats are going to be faced with some pretty heavy defeats. I think that hes got plenty of time to repair any political damage. My hope is that well see some improvement made in employment and in the economy. And so I believe that hes got a good chance not only to be the nominee which I had to fight for which I dont think hell have to fight for but to be re-elected.,

 You dont think any Democrat would challenge him?,

 I cant imagine that again.,

 Is there any Republican on the horizon you as a Democrat worry about?,

 Well I worry about whichever one they might choose because its obviously going to be a tough campaign. And I would hate to see the Republicans take over the White House and the House and maybe even the Senate. I think our country would be put back there if that should happen economically and in every other way. So I cant pick out one Republican that would concern me more than others.,

 What do you make of former Governor Palin?,

 I think shes a vivid political person that has made a major impact on the consciousness of the America both whether you like her or dont like her. I think shes extremely eloquent. She knows how to appeal to whatever audience is in front of her. And she has tremendous influence as she demonstrated for instance just recently in Delaware where she went in and endorsed an unknown woman who then prevailed in the Republican primary. I think that even the Republicans from what polls I have seen dont see her as a potential president. But they look on her with admiration.,

 Do you see her as a potential president?,

 I hope not no. I dont see her as a potential president.,

 Do you see her as a candidate? ,

 I think shell be very shrewd in making a decision to run for president depending on what the public opinion polls show about her being acceptable among Republicans. I think if she sees she can get the Republican nomination shell go for it. But so far according to the polls Ive seen Im completely outside of it.,

 Have you ever seen this country as divided as it is?,

 It never has been this divided. I dont think it was this divided as I said even during the time of Abraham Lincoln. Obviously during the war the Civil War the war between the states it was divided severely. But no its not been this divided. You know I had superb bipartisan support when I was president. As the years went by of my own presidency and ClintonI mean excuse me Senator Kennedy made more and more strong challenge to me he sapped away the liberal members of the Democratic party. And I turned more and more toward the moderate to conservative Democrats. Also to the Republicans. But I had Congressman Michael in the House and Baker in the Senate Howard Baker who really helped me inon key votes. So I got superb support from Republicans and Democrats.,

 There is no one like that around.,

 No. Theres no one like that around. And now they have kind of a solemn oath they take. If youre a Republican dont vote for Obama no matter what he proposes even if its good stuff.,

 Were going to have the president read another excerpt from White House Diary. This is the day he leaves office the inauguration of President Reagan.,

 This is exactly four years after the first one. On the inaugural platform my feelings were of regret that I had lost the election but a sense of relief to be free of the responsibilities for a while. Persistent though was my concern that at the last minute the hostages might not be released. I watched the ceremonies as a somewhat detached spectator without any emotional feelings. I thought that the speech was remarkable hackneyed nothing new just a collection of campaign material. I was glancing back at the Secret Service agent with the MC said would the president and First Lady please come forward. I had an involuntary inclination to stand up with Rosalyn but I realized he was talking about the Reagans. And then two minutes later I was informed that the hostage plane had taken off. They had been sitting in the plane since 10:00 that morning free and ready to be released.,

 Youre very critical of this book of the Washington press corp. Does that still stand?,

 I think theyre much better now than they were when I was president. I was critical of them because I thought there was a great distortion of what I was trying to do and doing. And ,

 Couldnt George Bush say the same thing?,

 I think any president might want to say the same thing except maybe a few. I think President Reagan was kind of a darling of the press a lot of his term. And I think probably John Kennedy was another one who enjoyed favorable reaction from ,

 Personality counts?,

 It does count a lot. And the ability to be part of their environment. Youre part of their environment too. I think Lyndon Johnson had a really hard time with the White House press corp.,

 What do you make of the Jon Stewart and StephenI know youre a Jon Stewart fan.,

 I am.,

 Youll be on his show later tonight?,

 Thats true.,

 What do you make of his rally? Rally to Restore Sanity?,

 And to preserve fear I think is what Colbert says. I think it will be an interesting event. I believe it will be a pretty large turnout. I think there will be a lot of humor in it. And it is going to be interesting to watch how they avoid any alignment towards a liberal or a conservative philosophy and make sure they stay kind of out of politics and still retain their role as humorous.,

 It s obviously in retaliation to the Tea Party and the Glenn Beck rally.,

 Thats what I surmise. Of course Jon Stewart hadnt told me that I dont think hes told his viewers yet exactly what his motivations are except as you say just to bring rationality back to the political debate and discussion.,

 Were back with President Carter. The book White House Diary. Whats next? Can you go solve a war somewhere solve peace go to an election? Youre not going to stop.,

 No. I just got back from North Korea and China. And we stay in touch with about 70 countries around the world which is the work of the Carter Center. So Ill continue to do that kind of work. Most of our effort at the Carter Center is in diseases curing and preventing and eradicating terrible diseases that still afflict the poorest and most helpless and needy people on earth. So Ill stay involved in the Carter Center as long as Im physically and mentally able. Im still a professor at Emory University. This is my 29th year as a professor. And Ill still write a book every now and then.,

 I know that. Many people you write about Hamilton Jordan Jody Powell Ted Kennedy Ronald Reagan Jerry Ford Anwar Sadat Yitzhak Rabin Scoop Jackson Robert Byrd theyre all gone. Does that give you pause?,

 Menachim Begin. It does.,

 Do you think about mortality?,

 The book is dedicated to Hamilton Jordan and to Jody Powell who were just about like my own sons and who helped me become and be president and governor. So it was with a great deal of emotion that I dedicated this book to them. But yes times change and people go on. And I think one thing I would like to remind the readers of this book although theres some very controversial and sometimes critical comments in there about me and them is that the book was written 30 years ago. And times have changed. And I changed my opinion about a lot of people but ,

 So read it with that?,

 Its an absolutely frank honest undisturbed unmodifiedI didnt change a single sentence meaning in the book about what it means to be president and to point out 30 or 40 things in the book really that I had to address that were very serious to me that Obama is having to address today.,

 Frank Sinatra told me the sad thing about aging is your friends are gone.,

 Thats exactly right.,

 Same with you?,

 Its sad of course. And every year it seems like more and more of them pass away. Some of those much earlier than they should have like Jody and Hamilton who were a generation behind me.,

 And your brother?,

 And my brother Billy who was 13 years younger than I was. So we have to be prepared for that.,

 Hows your health?,

 My health is good thank goodness.,

 Youre an amazing guy.,

 Thank you Larry for letting me come.,

 And youre a regular viewer which we count on.,

 I certainly am and have been for a long time.,

 So what else can she do? And how is she going to do it? Oprah for the hour next on Larry King Live. When we asked her to do this about six months ago she readily said yes. I cant thank you enough.,

 No Im happy to be here. I cant believe its 50 years for you.,

 Fifty years.,

 What does it feel like?,

 Fifty years.,

 Fifty years?,

 I remember it like it was yesterday.,

 Do you really?,

 Yeah I can remember my first day on air. Do you want to do 50?,

 You know what? I dont think Ill be doing 50. And its so interesting because I remember when Donahue was on. And Donahue did 25 and everyone said Donahues 25. You thinkand I said never I will do 25. It looks like God willing I will make 25 yeah.,

 I first met Oprah going on her show in Baltimore.,

 Yeah. In 19seventy-something.,

 78 or 79.,

 Yeah. Thats right.,

 And you brought my daughter on as a surprise guest.,

 How old is she now? How old is she?,

 Thirty-nine.,

 Ayeeee. Ayeee. Oh my God.,

 Do you feel your importance? Do you sense it?,

 No. If youre saying that Im important I understand that I have ...,

 Clout.,

 I understand that I have a wonderful platform that weve built over the years and I remember when you were doing your column forDo you remember this?,

 USA Today.,

 USA Today. And you had written a column and you said I would like to know who her publicist is. Do you remember that?,

 Yes.,

 Years ago. And at the time my publicist was an intern girl who had started the very first day I did who had not a clue aboutAlice McGee (ph) who later became a producer and later helped develop our book club idea. But when you wrote that article I said if he only knew that my publicist was a young girl who started the same day I did. Her first day out of college and I said to her when I started getting lots of mail I said Alice would you help me with the mail? Ill pay you a dollar a letter. And then I started getting so much mail I said I cant afford a dollar a letter anymore. So yeah its been a great ride for me. Its been really ...,

 During an interview you did with us in September you said I dont feel like I have used my life to the highest good.,

 Yeah.,

 Has that changed since opening the schools?,

 Well the opening of the school was one of the greatest days Ive ever experienced. Ever. I felt like I had 20 weddings all in one. It felt like everything Id heard people say weddings were. Like its like out of body you dont remember what happened youre sort of floating through it. So the opening of my leadership academy felt like that but it also felt like for me the process of getting to something is as good as actually arriving there. So the process of building the school and working for years to make it happen that was really wonderful. And then to sort of be there and actually see that these girls lives were going to change it was really wonderful.,

 So do you sometimes feel whats left to do?,

 No I dont feel that at all.,

 You dont at all.,

 No. Do you?,

 No. I dont.,

 No. OK. I know Katie is interviewing you tomorrow night but I thought I might give myself a little shot here.,

 What do you want to do ...,

 Well.,

 ... that you havent done?,

 Theres several things that I really want to do. I am on the airI am going to beI have like four five years left on my show and when Im done with that contract Im going to be done. Im ...,

 Thats a done deal.,

 Im going to be done. When Im done Im done.,

 You have an announcement to make.,

 No. Its not an announcement. Im just saying when Im done Im done.,

 OK.,

 OK. But before Im done I really doI feel strongly that I want that-my so-called legacy everybody uses the word legacy. I want the work the body of work for that show to have been not just for myself but for all the people who watch me and have grown up with me. No Im sure you get it too people say Ive been watching you since I was four. ,

 Its scary.,

 Yeah it is. Its scary when somebody says that. But I want to have changed the laws the laws state by state for child predators in this country. Thats what I want to have done. And I wont be satisfied until that is done.,

 You want to be then a political activist?,

 Is that what thats called?,

 Youre going to have to appear before state legislatures.Youre going to have to change laws.,

 Is that what thats called then?,

 Yeah. An activist.,

 Yeah. OK. Thats what Ill be then. I didnt know it had a name. Because what I was going to do I was going to use the public to help me because Im not going to do it by myself.,

 Youve got a platform.,

 Ive got a great platform. And you were asking me the question about clout. Whats the point of clout if you cant do something with it? So I thought I would use the clout to garner support from everybody else who is as outraged as me as I am.,

 Weve got to cover a lot of topics tonight.,

 OK.,

 And its an honor to have you.,

 I was going to bring youwhat do you give you? I was on my way here and I was I should be taking something like a ...,

 For you it would be a Mercedes Benz ...,

 I dont know. What do you need though?,

 I dont know. I need your just being here.,

 OK.,

 Its pleasure enough.,

 I did two shows and I came and I wanted to say happy anniversary.,

 You did a show last Thursday with the Rutgers basketball team.,

 Right. Right.,

 What is your read on the Imus story?,

 Ooh. I knew that. My read on the Imus story is that first of all I felt as theas Vivian Stringer the coach felt. I didnt have any great ideas about whether he should or shouldnt be fired. I felt that that would be left up to his bosses who have obviously decided that was what should happen. I know that I have my own radio channel and if somebody on my radio channel had made such degrading remarks I would have fired them. But I wasntI didnt want to get into it whether he should or should not because I think that should be left up to his bosses but the thing that really really saddened me is that we have reached a point in our society where someone could feel comfortable making such degrading remarks about women and not just women but racial remarks against women. So it was both racial and anti-feminist I thought.,

 So when you hear something like I-man said do you cringe do you get angry what is your reaction?,

 No because he wasnt talkingI cringe not because I feel this because Imus has no power in my life. And I would want those women to also know that when they were on my show and they were saying that he spoiled their moment and that it ruined it for them what I wanted to say but I had seven minutes is that he cant do that. He doesnt have the power to do that. Nobody has the power to do that to you. So I cringed because the very notion that we live in a society where anyone can call women hos makes me cringe.,

 Were back with Oprah kicking off our 50th anniversary week.,

 Katie Couric is here tomorrow. Katie is interviewing you. ,

 She is going to interview me. And then Wednesday night two hour special ...,

 Is she going to interview you like this or is she going to interview you by satellite?,

 No no. Like this.,

 Like this. OK.,

 Well be in New York.,

 OK. And then Friday night is everybody.,

 Bill Maher hosting a show with a lot of surprise guests. On this program ...,

 Yeah.,

 ... you endorsed Barack Obama.,

 Mm-hmm.,

 For the president. That still sticks right?,

 Yeah. Of course. ,

 Can a black man be elected president of the United States?,

 I believe he can. I believe a black man can and I believe he can.,

 You think he is going to win the nomination?,

 Im not here to say whether he will win or not but you asked me do I believe that he can? I believe that he can. Is it possible? Yes. I do believe that its possible.,

 Have you endorsed a candidate before?,

 Never.,

 What made you do so now?,

 Because I know him personally. I think that what he stands for what he has proven that he can stand for what he has shown was worth me going out on a limb for and I havent done it in the past because I havent felt that anybodyI didnt know anybody well enough to be able to say I believe in this person.,

 Is there a side of you the woman side that would lead toward a Hillary?,

 Well I have great respect for Hillary Clinton. II think Ive said this before and its true. Because I am for Barack does not mean I am against Hillary or anybody else. So the fact that I would endorse Barack Obama and the fact that I would support Barack Obama I have not one negative thing to say about Hillary Clinton.,

 Just you like Barack Obama?,

 I like Barack Obama.,

 Have you contributed to him?,

 I havent contributed.,

 Would you?,

 Well the truth of the matter is whether I contribute or not contribute you are limited to how much you contribute so my money isnt going to make any difference to him. I think that my value to him my support of him is probably worth more than any check ...,

 Dollars.,

 ... that I could write. Yeah.,

 Run for office yourself?,

 You know that is not going to ever happen.,

 Because? Why?,

 Because we just said Im going to become a political activist and I feel that ...,

 The next step could be ...,

 But no. I feel that the platform that I hold the chair in which I get to sit in every day and speak to the world is of far more value to me than any political office could be. Value in that I get to speak to peoples hearts and get to connect with people all over the world. Like right now. This is so amazing. Usually Im in a gym in South Africa in the middle of the morning because I cant sleep watching you and so are other people in the gym. Soplaces all over the world 200 countries. No matter what is going on around what country you are in you are there.,

 Its weird.,

 Its really weird. And then its interesting. Its the one comforting thing when youre in a foreign country. Theres Larry. Hi Larry. No matter what theres Larry.,

 Satellites are amazing.,

 Yeah.,

 Speaking of countries and South Africa one of my favorite places by the way.,

 Yeah.,

 When I visited there and went to Mandelas house ...,

 Uh-huh.,

 How did you get the idea to open that academy?,

 Because I was sitting with Nelson Mandela one of my personal heroes. And I dont know if I told you this story before but when I was doing Christmas kindness in South Africa I was invited to stay at Nelson Mandelas house and I was reallyI dont get nervous about meeting people but I was a little nervous about being in Nelson Mandelas house for 10 days straight. So I had 29 meals with him. Breakfast lunch and dinner. Twenty nine meals. And in the beginning I was really worried about what are we going to talk about? What am I going to say? And Steadman said relax hes Nelson Mandela. Hell no what to say youll just listen. And thats what happened. It was like one of the most amazing experiences of my life. So I love South Africa.,

 But that led to opening a school?,

 Yeah. I was sitting in his living room one day and we were talking about what was needed and what I could do and I said what I wanted to do is build a school because I believe that education can save the world. And that would be the mark that I get to leave on the world is that I throughout developing countries when you say is there anything left to do there are 100 million girls in the world right now who will never have the opportunity to go to elementary school. Before I die I want that to change.,

 Youre going to build more schools?,

 Yeah. Im going to build more schools. I just spoke with a school outside of Durban about three hours outside of Durban actually I didnt built it I organized the process of building it but took the money from the people who gave it to me for my Angel Network and we built a model school. I mean train the women how to make the bricks in the village went out into the communities and met with people for a year and said to people tell us what you need for a school. And these are poor villagers no running water no electricity. We built a channel underneath the school and built a windmill so that the children play on it and pump the war. So wewhen it rains we save the water and pump the water so now they have toilets.,

 How do you react to the critics who say why not build it in Montgomery Alabama?,

 Because we have a government that builds schools. I dont have to do that. I live in the best country in the world. I live in the country where had I not had the opportunities that Ive had thank God almighty born in 1954 I wouldnt be able to sit here with you or to stand where I stand every day. So we live in a country where education is free. Thats what people miss. That education is free in this country. So I want to make that possible for children in the world who dont have that opportunity.,

 By the way in honor of Oprah ...,

 You wear the color purple.,

 Which is still on Broadway right?,

 Its still on Broadway and opening in Chicago on May 1st and moving out throughout the country.,

 You said in an interview last year that you failed in an effort to mentor a group of girls from your adopted hometown of Chicago.,

 Yeah.,

 How?,

 I failed because I think its really nice to do nice things for people but I reached a point in my life where I dont just want to do nice things or do good things I really want to be able to change peoples lives forever and I strongly believe that the way to do that is changing the way people think about their lives and that education - you cant change a kid unless you educate a kid you really cant. You can give them shoes you can give them a place to stay you can give them food for a day but I am in the business I think now of being able to teach people how to fish. You know that whole fish for a day or teach people how to fish. And so years ago when I first moved to Chicago because I was a poor kid and always knew that Id have to find a way to give back and I started a mentoring program just for women in my office and going into the projects sort of adopting these girls out of the projects and trying to take them places on the weekend. The first thing I did was to take them all to get library cards. I wasnt successful because I didnt have the time or the attention to give to them that would be able to break the cycle of poverty for them.,

 You learned from that.,

 SoI learned from that. Youve got to be able toso thats why I decided I want to build a school that I can have the girls full time and change the way they think change what they think is possible for themselves.,

 What is it like to be very poor ...,

 Yeah.,

 ... and then very rich? I mean ...,

 Its the best. Its the best. Its the best. Every day I ...,

 Well put.,

 Its the best because every day I think I have it so much better than people who are born rich.,

 Oh yeah. So much.,

 Dont you think the fact ...,

 To make it ...,

 Dont you think the fact that you had to struggle ...,

 Sure.,

 The fact that you never had everything.,

 But whats it like to have an absurd amount of money? By absurd amount of money in that you can ...,

 I dont call it absurd Larry.,

 What do you call it?,

 I call itI dont know what I call it. I dont have a name for it but I dont think it is absurd. But I do think this is the weird thing. That even now I will be in a store and I will be looking at something and I will think should I get this one should I get the green one or the yellow one and it will dawn on me I can get both. I can get both. I can get the whole rack.,

 You can get the store.,

 I can getyeah so thatsome things I have some still old habits like someone said that we were in a hotel not too long ago and it was like were not sending out for the laundry because you know they charge you five dollars for a pair of panties. So some thingsI still cant get over some things.,

 You still ...,

 Oh no.,

 Four dollar handkerchiefs no.,

 Gayle will tell you this. Recently I was in a hotel and I called her and said Call me right back. Because you know when you dial from a hotel phone if you dont use like a calling card or something its like I dont know ...,

 Eight dollars.,

 A minute. So Ill call and say will you call me back because its too expensive. And she says who is this? Yeah. So some things like that I still hold on to.,

 Are you an easy touch with old friends?,

 What does that mean?,

 A guya woman calls you up who knew you when you were in high school. No. A girl who worked with you in Baltimore.,

 Uh-huh.,

 Is on the skids.,

 Uh-huh.,

 Easy touch?,

 Yeah.,

 Are you?,

 You mean would I help you out?,

 Yeah.,

 Ive done that for a few people. Ive done that for a few people.,

 Must have a lot of people. I knew you when Oprah...,

 But this isno but this is what you have to do. This is what Ive learned. You cannot. I never loan money. You only loan money Larry. You know this. You only loan money if you never want to see the person again. So thats what I call sometimes an exit fee for some people. You loan the money and youll never have to worry about them calling you again because they wont pay you back.,

 Yeah.,

 And you know theyre not going to pay you back. But for the most part if somebodythat actually happened to me not too long ago. Somebody I had known in Nashville actually that helped me get into radio called and said literally helped me get into radio because I started just like you started and I said Im going to give you this money Im going to give you exactly this and you never have to pay me back.,

 Smart thing to do.,

 Yeah. Because that way you dont have to worry about it. You know?,

 Were back with Oprah and she just said ...,

 Isnt it weird we getyou get paid for talking ...,

 We get paid.,

 Youve been paid for 50 years for talking.,

 Isnt that dumb.,

 No I ...,

 Its not dumb. Because youre good at it you get paid for talking. I get paid for talking.,

 But I still am amazed at it.,

 But it aint work.,

 Its not.,

 We dont go to work.,

 No. No.,

 You go to your show.,

 Yeah.,

 But you dont go to work.,

 No. I feel likeyou know we say this all the time on my show that you can find something you love. And I always as a kid I loved talking. I was always talking in school. I was the first woman in myand I cant believe that I get paid and paid a lot of money for talking.,

 How about the down side of the business?,

 Yes.,

 How do you react to tabloids having a field day with you? You and Steadman and ...,

 Ive actually grown up with it. You know weve been together now over 20 years and Ive been you know this sort of known person for about the same amount of time and I have actually matured with it. It used to just make me so upset and so mad all the time. I was just talking to my friend Quincy Jones the other day. I remember years ago I was on the cover of TV Guide or something. They put my head on Ann Margarets body. And Im like crying because of crazy stuff you know like I cant believe theyre saying. And I was sitting on a pile of money. Theyre acting like I justand so Bill Cosby had said to me one time Put your head in a paper bag breathe deeply three times and move on. So I really have gotten to the point wherethats what I was saying to you earlier aboutI was hoping that the women of Rutgers wouldnt allow all of this degrading talk about who they were to affect how they felt about themselves because nobody can make you feel badly about yourself.,

 What do you make of your influence with books? That you can ...,

 Well it just started as a fluke. I was saying that I started out with a young intern who started the exact same day that I did Alice McGee. And her job was to sort of be a runner for me in the Beginning so shed go get me pantyhose at the Walgreens store and come back and bring lunch and that kind of thing. And Alice then I started paying her to be my publicist and then she moved up and became an associate producer producer. And Alice and I used to exchange books all the time and we would you know say what are you reading now what are you reading? And one day she said why dont we do this on TV? And I go itll never work on television you know. America doesnt read and you cant talk about books on television. And she said what if we had a club. So thats how it all started. And I am surprised every time.,

 And then you stopped it for a while.,

 I stopped it because I was overwhelmed trying to because somebody just saidan audience member just said to me the other day as I handed out the latest book The Road by Cormac McCarthy. Have you read this book?,

 No.,

 I should have brought you that for your anniversary. You should read that book.,

 The Road.,

 Yes The Road by Cormac McCarthy. You know why? Because its about a father and son at the end of time and fathers love this book.,

 Well Im a father.,

 So for youyoure a father all right. Hows Chance?,

 Chance and Cannon are both fine.,

 Nice.,

 Theyre eight and seven now.,

 See. Yes you would have loved this book. Anyway so ...,

 Youd be a great mother.  I now feel like I am a mother Larry.,

 OfOh.,

 I have 151 girls. I am a mother to 151 ...,

 And by the way on that were there complaints that that school is too strict? Parents cant get to see their kids or something?,

 Well there was some complaints about it but I pay no attention to it. Pay no attention to that many behind the counter like in The Wizard of Oz. Pay no attention to the man behind the door. There were two complaints. Two that ended up being blown out of Proportion. And I called the two parents and said to the two parents who were allegedly complaining that if you have a problem with the way we are running this school please feel free to come and get your daughters at any time because Im not changing the rules because you dont like the rules. And theyre complaining because theres no junk food. And I go there isnt and theres not going to be. And theyre complaining because it took too long for them to get through security at the gates because the kidswhen they come to see their children I make you go through security with whoever youre bringing. Im not changing that. And if you dont like that you can come and get your daughter any time you want. Feel free to do that. Im not changing the rules. And theyre complaining because we had a major problem with cell Phones cell phones. Some of the girlsyou know because some of the girlsyou can only come to my school if your parents make less than $10000 a year. No more than $10000 a year. So theres a range. Some children have families that make nothing and some make seven eight nine and almost 10. OK so some of those kids can afford cell phones and thats the first thing they all want is cell phones. And we had a rule in school that you cannot bring your cell phones to class. I cannot have the cell phones ringing in the classrooms. I said to the girls what should the rules be? And they said that we should not have the cell phones in class. And then several girls broke that rule. So now you know what Im going to do? Im going to take the cell phones away and thats what we did. So parents were complaining about that.,

 Oprah and I were involvedand I havent talked to her about it...,

 Nice.,

 ...off the air or on in one of the deals dealing with a book.,

 What?  I had the author on you called in to say he was fine ...,

 Oh that thing that thing.,

 Thats called a grabber. Dont go away.,

 Oh that thing.,

 Were back with Oprah on our 50th anniversary week. She is the kickoff guest.,

 Im the kickoff guest.,

 We had thatan incident. James Frey came on our show.,

 Yes.,

 Hed written a book called A Million Little Pieces.,

 Yes.,

 It was one of the books you selected as your book of the month.,

 Yes.,

 Later people complained that it was fraud or he didnt do the things he said he did.,

 Yes.,

 At the end of the show when he was on being contrite you called in his mother was on with him.,

 Yes.,

 You said I stand by you.,

 I stand by you.,

 The mother started to cry they grabbed his hands. It was one of the great moments on television. Headlines next day Oprah Stands By. ,

 Yes.,

 Next week Oprah Annihilates James Frey.,

 I didnt annihilate him. You can even ask him. I didnt annihilate. At the end of that conversation on my show I said look I know I was tough on you but I had to be tough on you because you really disappointed me and so he understood that. And actually I called him a couple days later to see how he was doing.,

 Whats yournow in looking back.,

 Well it made me very wary of doing memoirs and so you will notice that since that time Ive only chosen two memoirs. First of all I went a whole year because I had chosen Elie Wiesels book.,

 Great book.,

 Yes. And I chose Night because I so believe in Elie Wiesel and I know that everything that he had said in that book was true and you know knew that was true. So I felt that that was reallynot only did I love that book or wanted other people to experience it the way I had experienced it but also I could trust that it was the truth. And soand then I went a year and didnt choose a book because I was working for the school and just honestly didnt have time to read any other books. And then the next book I chose that I could trust was the truth was Sidney Poitiers book. And so ...,

 Which was the next number one paperback?,

 Yes number one. So now Ive moved on from memoirs because I dont knowyou know because a lot of publishersI was surprised to find that the publishers do not vet the stories or vet the books. And in the case of James Frey it hadnt been. So I was trusting the publisher you know.,

 When you get a major publisher thats logical.,

 Thats right.,

 We all in this business trust the publisher.,

 I was trusting that the publisher knew that it was true or not and so thats why I felt so comfortable you know calling up at the end of the show. I couldnt find the number. Whats the number whats Larrys number? How do we get through and theres only a minute left. So I called up and then later regretted that I had made that call. And I made it because Im thinking well if it wasnt true the publisher would have said it wasnt true. They would have said it was fiction but that is not always the case.,

 Whats your barometer for picking the book? What does it have to do?,

 I just have toits the same thing as anybody else who reads a book and says you know God I love that book.,

 Dont you love five six books a month? I do. I love a lot of books.,

 I dont get a chance to read five or six that I love because I have read so many things that arethat I have to read for this show. And so in terms of like a good book that I feel I love it and at least a million other people love it I dont run into that very often.,

 Do you. What ...,

 And I have to read every book. Thats why I was saying the other day on my show a woman said to me did you read the book? How insulting is that? Did I read the book?,

 So Ive got to get The Road.,

 The Road By Cormac McCarthy.,

 When youre with a guestand this affects all of usand you either disagree or dont like them. Is that the hardest part of the day?,

 No. The hardest part of the day is paying the bills because I still pay all my bills and I look through all the ...,

 You still write the checks?,

 I still write the checks. Yes I do.,

 How about the guests that you dont like?,

 It doesnt matter. You know I am a very spiritually centered person. So theres very few people that I dont like and if I dont like you its because your vibe is so negative that its almost hard to even sit next to you. I tell you whats difficult isand I was going to ask you this question. When youre with a guest that you know is lying you know ...,

 All you can do is all you can doyou try to go ...,

 You know they are skirting around the truth.,

 And you try to go to the curb and get to it.,

 Yes.,

 Of course its not a trial. ,

 No its not a trial. Its not supposed to be a trial.,

 You cant hold him in contempt.,

 Now have you ever done an interviewI know Katie is doing an interview tomorrow night OK have you ever done an interview where you know that you asked the wrong question and youthe person shut down.,

 Oh yes.,

 Thats happened.,

 Thats happened. Have you ever had ...,

 Yes that happened to me. Years ago I was ...,

 I bet.,

 ... interviewing Sally Field and I asked her a veryand she was dating Burt Reynolds at the time. Was it Burt Reynolds?,

 Yes Burt Reynolds.,

 OK she was dating Burt Reynolds at the time and I asked her an inappropriate question. I will say its inappropriate so I wont repeat it. I asked her an inappropriate question and I saw the veil come down. And I was on live television and she basically shut down. So I learned from that experience. Dont ask a question thats going to put a person in a compromising position or an embarrassing position when youre on live television. Theyll shut down on you and then where do you go.,

 And then when theyre shut ...,

 Its over.,

 ...they dont come back.,

 They dont come back. Theyre not giving up anything for you.,

 Back with more of Oprah.,

 Yes.,

 Were back with Oprah. Wee have an e-mail question for Oprah. When we announced you were going to be on someone sent an e-mail. ,

 Yes.,

 From Adrian (ph) in Athens Georgia. If you could go back in time and talk to yourself at age 12...,

 OK.,

 ...what one piece of advice or sentence of encouragement would you offer to the young Oprah?,

 Twelve.,

 Twelve. What would you say?,

 We did this in my magazine. Im not trying to promote my magazine but we did this asking your younger self. Gee 12 I wasthat was a very rough time for me. I would probably say like hang in there.,

 It was a rough time?,

 It was veryyeah yes it was a rough time. Twelve 14 very rough time.,

 Family rough?,

 Yeah family rough. I was being you know sexually abused at the time. I just recently saw for myself my mother had saved I dont have anything from my past but she saved a certificate from the SearsI mean like Sears & Roebuck charm school.,

 You went to the ...,

 I went to the Sears & Roebuck charm school and I was 12 years old and I just saw papera clipping.,

 You graduated?,

 Yes I graduated from the charm school and I saw a picture of myself and my goshI had on the cat-eye glasses and I am so unattractive. I am like one little ugly girl. You know I felt so bad about myself. Thats why I wanted to go to charm school.,

 The number one book in the United States now running for a long time is The Secret.,

 Yes.,

 We have done some shows on it. You have done some shows.,

 Yes,

 What do you make of this?,

 Well what I make of it is I was really very excited that this line of thinking this level of I call consciousness has reached the masses in such a way that that book could be number one. I was really very excited about it because basically the message of The Secret is the message that Ive been trying to share with the world on my show for the past 21 years. The message is that youre really responsible for your life. You are responsible for your life. I have known thisIve known this since The Color Purple. In 1985 I probably told you this story when I did The Color Purple but in 1985 I did The Color Purple. Prior to that I had read the book Larry. This is when I got the secret thing but I didnt know it was called The Secret. I read the book The Color Purple and then went out and got books for everyone else I knew and I was obsessed about this story obsessed about it. I ate slept thought all the time about The Color Purple. I moved to Chicago. I get a call from a casting agent asking would I like to come and audition for a movie. Ive never gotten a call in my life from anybody for a movie or anything like that. And I say is it The Color Purple. And he says No its a movie called Moonsong. And I go well Ive been praying for The Color Purple. And I go to the audition and of course it was The Color Purple. I audition. I dont hear anything for months. And I go to this fat farm and I think its because Im fat because I was about 212 pounds at the time. And I think I didnt get the call back because Im so fat. And I am at this fat farm and I am praying and crying saying to God help me let this go because I wanted to be in this movie so much. I wanted it I wanted it I wanted it. I thought I was going to be in the movie. There were all these signs that I was should be in the movie. And I go to this fat farm and Im praying and crying and as Im on the track singing this song I surrender all I surrender all all to thee my blessed savior I surrender all. I am singing that song praying and crying. A woman comes out to me and she says on the track its raining and she says Theres a phone call for you. And the phone call was Stephen Spielberg saying I want to see you in my office in California tomorrow. Now what I learned from that that moment absolutely changed my life forever because I had drawn The Color Purple into my life. I didnt know Stephen Spielberg. I didnt know Quincy Jones who saw me in Chicago in 1984. He was there for a lawsuit that was being filed against Michael Jackson because he had been working on his Thriller album. And he saw me on 8:00 A.M. Chicago and said Thats Sophia. Now I didnt know him. I didnt know anybody that had anything to do with that. But I knew that I had drawn that into my life and it changed the way I thought about my life forever.,

 So youre not surprised at the success of The Secret.,

 Im thrilled for the success of The Secret. I think that the message needs to go further because I think the mistake that was made with The Secret is that they tried tothey dont know who they arethat they tried to let that be the answer to all questions. Its not the answer. Its just one law. The law of attraction is one law. There are many laws working in the world. But it is very true that the way you think creates reality for yourself. There are other factors going on so its not everything but you really can change your own reality based on the way that you think.,

 Time flies. By the way dont forget Oprah and Friends on XM Satellite Radio. Youre having fun with that?,

 Yes Im having fun with that.,

 Theyre going to have a special channel for Larry King for a week starting today.,

 Really?,

 It started today. The Larry King channel its XM-130. What are you?,

 Im 156. XM-156. Does the 50-year anniversarywhat does it really mean? I mean I I know were all celebrating you and...,

 It mean Im old. It means Ive been around 50 years.,

 Yes.,

 I cant believe it.,

 Andwhat are you most impressed with how its changed in 50 years?,

 Oh what you mentioned before all those 200 plus countries.,

 Yes.,

 When I was a kid in Brooklyn...,

 Yes.,

 ...I dreamed of being on the radio. Just if I could do Dodger games. That would be the world would be Dodger games.,

 Wow yes.,

 No it was CNN my God.,

 Two-hundred countries.,

 Moscow they watch.,

 Does anybody intimidate you?,

 No I learned well (ph) because the host controls the show. You know that.,

 Yes yes yes.,

 Youre going to speak at Howard University.,

 Yes Im going to speak. Yes I dont know what Im going to say yet but Ill be working on it.,

 Dont know what youre going to do yet.,

 Yes I dont know what Im going to say.,

 Anybody you want to interview?,

 You know the people that for me that I learned the most and they are the most memorable for me because obviously you interview celebrities I interview celebrities and celebrities are fun wonderful to have on if you can get them. But its the real folks. Like I interviewed a woman a couple years ago. She had been hit by a drunk driver and burned alive in her car. Face completely burned off. Her name was Jackie (ph). And you know everybody talks the talk and I say a lot of this in my magazine about looking for your inner beauty. And it was a moment sitting with that woman Larry who had had her whole face burned off and her ears are pinned back andjust really. And she saidI asked her whether there were times she wanted to die and she said no I have too much to live for. And I thought my God that is walking the walk. You know thats not just you know verbalizing talking about it. And most recently I had a guy on who was in a big plane crash and heSingapore Airlines about six nine years ago. I cant remember how many years. But as he was leaving the plane he said all the bodies were on fire on the plane. And he looked back and he saw that auras were coming up out of the bodies up out of the flames and that he wasnt a religious person but he learned in that moment that he wantedand that some auras were brighter than others and that he said I want to live my life so that my aura is always bright. And so that kind of thing really impacts me.,

 Are you happy?,

 On a scaleI just did a happiness show.,

 Oh yes?,

 I am off the charts. I am off the charts.,

 You ...,

 Im off the charts happy.,

 On a scale of 10 youre an 11. Are you? Are you an 11 on a scale of 10?,

 Probably 15.,

 Whoa!,

 Yes Im off the charts.,

 Youre off the charts.,

 Yes.,

 Oprah I know that one of your catch phrases is what I know for sure.,

 Yes. Well may I say that that catch phrase came from the late Gene Siskel because I had been interviewed by Gene Siskel many years ago and he asked me at the end of the interview what do you know for sure? And I was so stumped that I went home and like three days later and I called him up and he goes the interview is over Oprah. I dont need to know now.,

 Well what I know for sure ...,

 Yes.,

 ...is this was a great hour.,

 Thank you.,

 And Ive been honored to have you...,

 Oh thank you.,

 ...as our first guest of the week.,

 Thank you. Happy anniversary Larry.,

 Thank you doll.,

 Really.,

 Tomorrow night ...,

 Katie Couric ...,

 Turns the table. ,

 ... turns the table. Yes.,

 Tonight Jon Stewart counting down to hosting this Sundays Oscar show where anything can happen. Making you laugh with all the latest news as only he can. Well take your calls too. Jon Stewart for the hour is next on Larry King Live. Its a great pleasure to welcome Jon Stewart to our program. Hes going to host the Academy Awards this Sunday night.,

 This Sunday? Oh gees.,

 And hes here tonight kicking offare you nervous? You got to be nervous.,

 Im always nervous. Youre a huge star. You have very probing questions. Im always nervous when Imwhen Im on your program.,

 How about the Academy Awards?,

 Ah not so much. No Im excited more than I am nervous. I know it seems to be portrayed as a bigger deal. Maybe Im not understanding it.,

 people that bomb.,

 Yes but I bombed in front of you know a lot of different audiences. This will just be the most famous audience that I bombed in front of. I bombed once so badly at Radio City Music Hall when they reopened and when I walked off stage Shirley Jones hugged me the Partridge Family mother. I walked off stage. I didnt even know her and she just did this oh and then I had to go and accept a hug from Shirley Jones.,

 But when youre this bigfirst of all how did you get this?,

 Its a big event but...,

 How did you get it?,

 Im sorry?,

 How did you get this offer?,

 Oh they called and I said sure. Im not even sure they got out Academy Awards before I said sure. They said Would you like to and I said sure and that was it. It was actually quite simple. They called right around Christmas so it was very exciting for me. Besides you know Jews dont normally get presents around that time of year. Normally we just sleep in so it was kind of exciting.,

 How are you approaching it?,

 With a workman-like focus a laser-like focus with energy with discipline. I get up around 5:00 usually pretty hammered and I roll over .,

 Youre revved up.,

 No I got a couple of my guys with me from The Daily Show were out writing. I mean the truth is weve been doing The Daily Show for all the way up until just this week so Ive kind of been focused on that. And at home my wife and I just had another baby so Ive also been thinking about that. So you know this is a nice period for me to really be able to sit down and focus on it.,

 Speaking of that youre newest baby is Maggie Rose (ph) right?,

 Newest baby you make it sound like a line of clothing.,

 We havewe have a Republican and a Democrat.,

 Ah that is the sweetest.,

 What better gift for Jon Stewart?,

 You know what theres nothing that a 3-week-old appreciates more than an ironic gesture.,

 And its cuddly.,

 Thank you. This isthis is lovely and it has a flag and oh look at that made in China hum. So it really does represent the parties. Thats exciting. Is thatare you sure this is a donkey?,

 It looks like a donkey. Its sort of weird-looking donkey.,

 Its a little bit of a weird-looking donkey and you got this from the CNN Gift Shop?,

 No. I dont know where. The crew got it., 

 Does CNN have a giftyou didnt get this?,

 We have a gift...,

 Well thank you for the thoughtful gift that your crew picked up while you were getting spa treatments. Im ashamed of you. This is reallythank you so much to the unpaid interns. When are you guys going to .,

 Is it true are you picking the Oscar winners?,

 Yes. This year theyre going to try something different is just right before the announcement Im just going to write whatever name pops into my head on a card and thats who wins. Its very different this year because Price Waterhouse as you know was bought by a company in Dubai so the security at this years Oscars is going to be handled by an Arab company.,

 So in other words this will be a set up?,

 What will be a set up?,

 The winners. You will know the winner before its announced?,

 No no of course its a very protected process and its very secretive and no one can know. Actually no one does know untilI feel badly for the guy in the orchestra. Bill Conte has to learn all five songs depending on whether or not whos going to win. Im hoping Terrence Howard wins. I just want to hear Bill Conte and the orchestra play Its Tough out Here for a Pimp. I just want to hear how that sounds with violins. Have you been to the Oscars?,

 Ive never you know Ive never. I go to the Vanity Fair party but Ive never been to the Oscars. Oh George Clooney invited me to be his guest this year.,

 And Im sure he meant that. Im sure he did.,

 Im holding him.,

 What could happen? If it goes badly for me what could happen? Will they stop honoring film? Like what really is the huge jeopardy here? Its really just for me right?,

 Theres no jeopardy. The only jeopardy is you.,

 Except for me is that I will be scorned.,

 I mean do you know that lets say Letterman had a bad time is that part...,

 And he seems to have bounced back. He seems to have done reasonably well.,

 Yes I would say. ,

 Yes so I think thatand by the way have you ever watched that show like I have a DVD of it? Hes hilarious. Hes really funny on it. Its actually quite funny and theOprah thing that everybody always talks about he tagged it with Oh and also I want to introduce you to my friend Keanu and the place went crazy. They laughed like hell. So its you know the lore of it is somewhat different than it seems the reality.,

 You are very cool with this.,

 Im sorry?,

 Youre very cool with this.,

 Im excited. You know I feel like so you give up a homerun in the All Star game do you know what I mean? At least you got there. I have very low expectations for myself so this is one of those things that you know it has surprised me so far peoples anxiety level for me. You know theresI really have gotten a sense where people are like Are you OK? And I just think yes.,

 Well you know why. Youre not Hollywood. Youre not...,

 Right.,

 Youre different.,

 But thats why I think the jeopardy is much less for me. What are they going to do bump me down from basic cable? How far lower? Where am I going to go public access? What can happen? This is the biggest stage Ive ever been on. Its the grandest opportunity Ive ever had. I just think itsI vow to enjoy it.,

 Are you going to have a spectacular opening?,

 Oh!,

 A Billy Crystal kind of thing a dance a dance?,

 As you know I am a triple threat.,

 Are you going to do something? Are you going to dance?,

 Im going toI have been studying some of the openings. Ive got a Gene Kellythat is going to blow you away. Its going to be aIm sorry did I say Gene Kelly? I meant Gene Rayburn.,

 Thats too hip for them.,

 Its too hip for the room all right fair enough.,

 All right lets move to some things. Jon Stewart will host the Oscars Sunday night.,

 Its going to be the most controversial Oscars ever. I would not be surprised if the whole country tunes in.,

 Will you truthfully will you get into politics?,

 Sorry? You mean after I retire as a comedian?,

 No will you get into politics Sunday?,

 Oh Im sure there will be references and such like that but Im notIm not going out there you know looking to blow the place up. I want toI want to do a nice job. Really for the most part the pressure I feel is for the actors and actresses and people that are nominated and who are there and its their big day and you dont want to screw up their wedding. You dont want to be the deejay going you know all right everybody lets play Celebrate. Wheres my CD? You know.,

 Have they given you any parameters like you cant say this?,

 Yes gigantic booklet.,

 Really?,

 Terrible terrible restrictions on many things no adverbs. I dont even know where that comes from. Why wouldnt you want something that could help describe a noun or a verb or a...,

 Any rules?,

 No theyve been very cool. They do want to see the stuff beforehand.,

 Like they havent said dont messthey do?,

 Yes they said you have to do I think the quota was six gay cowboy jokes. Apparently every show that goes on from now until next February has to have six gay cowboy jokes including non- film award shows which I think is .,

 I read somewhere youve only seen one movie the whole year.,

 No thats ridiculous.,

 Thats what it said.,

 40 Year Old Virgin.,

 Thats the only one you saw?,

 Quite good. No Ive actually seen quite a few and enjoyed them tremendously and Im stunned at the quality of the nominees this year.,

 Were back with Jon Stewart. All right what do you make of that story?,

 Now what story was that?,

 The Cheney story?,

 It was obviouslythe fact that the guy was OK was the whole as far as for a comedian goes thats the whole reason you could sort of dine on it for a week. Obviously if the guy had been seriously injured or when he had the heart attack we downgraded it from pants wettingly funny to still pretty funny but there is a tinge of sadness. There is some melancholy. If he had died obviously it moves into Brechtian territory. Then its not so funny unless sung.,

 Do you hunt?,

 Im sorry?,

 Do you hunt?,

 I hunt in the most dangerous quarry of all Larry man. No I dont. Ive never hunted. I held a gun once in a bar fight but I was behind the bar and an off duty cop got clocked and it was at anconcert. The bar that I worked at was City Gardens in New Jersey and I ended up with the guys gun behind a bar and very heavy the gun and I realized right then I would never make a cop because I could never do this. If I had the gun it would be one of these there you go. But I can understand why itswhy shooting things is interesting although not the wayapparently theres a thing that they do where its not exactly like in the wild because they dont have that much time and the birds are raised in a pen and their wings are taken off and you know because itsbecause the vice president travels obviously with you know doctors and a medical helicopter and the cast of ER or whatever the hell hes got with him So a real bird Im sure would be like Oh my God listen to that and theyd be out of there so theythey hunt what we call quail tarts which are specially raised birds that hear noise and go Im going to go check that out walk over and the vice president can just walk right up to them and either shoot them with his gun or hit them in the face with his hammer whatever he wants to do.,

 Sport its not?,

 It doesnt seem to be sport. It seems to be hunting for unbelievably rich busy people. I love the description too of the guy he shot was literally like a Bush pioneer who also runs you know his own country somewhere.,

 CBS poll just out...,

 Yes.,

 ...Bush 34 percent lowest rating hes ever had and Cheney 18 percent.,

 The 18 percent thing is you really have to think of this inlets look at this just purely statistically. Four out of five dentists surveyed recommend sugarless gum for their patients who chew gum. So there is one out of five dentists who say You chew gum? Ah why not put sugar in it? These are not the best dentists OK thats 20 percent. Hes not even getting all the dentists who recommend sugared gum. Thats low. I think Dracula has a higher Q rating right now than the vice president.,

 And the president 34?,

 Thirty-four percent isthats a little bit shocking because I always thought he would never dip sort of below 40 percent. I felt like he sort of had this...,

 Core.,

 He seems like hes a really good president for one very particular part of the country and they have really rallied around him and when you start to lose that support you know hes neverwhen you look at the vote how it breaks down its you know 51 percent for Bush 49 percent for whoever the Democrat was but the Democrats have only like two or three percent of the power. The fact that Bush is having you know the base that he goes with erode I think that says a lot.,

 What do you make of this Arab Emirate story and guarding the ports?,

 Im trying to figure out how whoever is running the ports could inspect actually less than the five percent that are inspected now. I mean apparently they only inspect five percent of what comes in there so you dont know if you know when a ship comes in you dont know if its unloading rattan chairs for Pier 1 Imports or Chinese sex slaves like nobody has any idea. So Im not exactly sure what thatI know that it sounds bad. I know that if you know in America today its as though somebody has stoked fear in this country. I dont know who that might have been but it appears that the country is poised to react lets say reflexively with a certain xenophobic zeal.,

 But when you stoke fear why then would you have the people you are saying to be fearful of run your ports?,

 Because you forgot you had stoked the fear. Im not so sure theyre paying much attention to the speeches they gave three weeks ago. Were at war. Then three weeks later. I dont understand. Whats wrong with the port deal? You know its as though when youre at war you know he put us on war footing. You remember that. And then he seemed absolutely shocked that anyone would complain that perhaps our ports might be run from foreign nationals although apparently most of them are. The more you look into it the more it seems like not a very big story but I think like everything people are reacting to the way that this administration does their business which is I really feel like Bush just is like Santa. I know whos naughty. I know whos nice. You have no reason to pay attention. No the Dubai guys are OK. These guys over here theyre evildoers. These guys are OK. Dont look into it.,

 Well be right back with Jon Stewart. This Sunday night he will host the Academy Awards.,

 Sunday?,

 Were back. You like Mahers work?,

 Yes thats a good joke. Hes solid.,

 Were all into him. OK. Jack Abramoff.,

 Abramoff apparently you know hes a...,

 Pled guilty.,

 Hes pled guilty. Let me tell you something. This is no wayhes a guy. Hes an Orthodox Jew who is running what is a corrupt lobby. This in no way reinforces any negative stereotypes that people may have had towards lets say Jews just a bad apple just a guy who happens to accept money from whoever comes for corruption and personal favors. I think its good for us. I think its good for the Jews.,

 Good for the Jews?,

 Next question.,

 And,

 What do you think? Have you ever had Abramoff? Every time a guys comes up...,

 No Ive never had Abramoff.,

 ...that isthat isthat they find out like Ken Lay like any of those guys everybody starts walking away like get away. Yes who was this Abramoff guy? Apparently hes the guy that literally financed the entire infrastructure for this whole K Street project for the entire sort of GOP renaissance in Washington.,

 They all back off.,

 Everybody. Bush you know whenever that happens he did the same thing with Chalabi Abramoff Yes I think I met him at a Hanukkah celebration. We lit a candle at it. I didnt remember his name. I think I shook his hand. I dontand then theres like pictures with like the two of them naked in a sauna. Youre just like whats going on around here? Why dont they ever own up? You know Chalabi Chalabi the name is somethingthen they show footage you know Chalabi is sitting directly behind Laura at the State of the Union address you know literally flicking her ear. I think I heard of him.,

 Who in this administration fascinates you the most?,

 The American people for their just utter patience. And everybody it just seems like I just dont know what its going to take. What else you know there is this wholemy mind has been blown just so consistently by this administrations insistence on their own competence without ever sort of delivering kind of any sort of evidence to that. I think at this point everybody just kind of rolls their eyes like ah those guys are at it again.,

 Who do you see on the Democratic side of the ledger forging forth?,

 I like this guy John Kennedy since him not so much. No theres not I mean I dont really see anybody forging forth from there. I dont.,

 Hillary?,

 Well certainly shespeople recognize her name and go Hey thats that lady that was married to the president. Lets vote her in. You know I dont see anybody out there who has inspired. You know everybody thought Barack Obama was going to be when he came into Washington but you know the Senate seems like the place where smart people go to die like it does and you never hear from them again. So you know Im not exactly sure. Do you have a favorite on the Democratic side? Do you haveIm not even sure...,

 Well the former governor of Virginia Mr. Warner seems very impressive.,

 Oh is that so?,

 You dont know him?,

 No I dont know anyone.,

 Mark Warner hes very...,

 Mark Warner OK Ill vote for him then.,

 You dont have to vote for him.,

 No Im fine. If you say it if youre vouching Ill vote. Is that a vouch?,

 Im not vouching. Hes an impressive guy.,

 You gave him a vouch. Dont back off of the vouch. Thats a vouch.,

 Im backing off of the vouch.,

 Im voting for Warner.,

 Frist.,

 Lets vote tomorrow. Frist please! He diagnosed Terri Schiavo as not being in a persistent vegetative state from like five seconds of a videotape. The guys a cardiologist Ah she looks OK. I mean thats the whole thing. This country we cant even get the two political parties to agree on what reality is. You know the Democrats look at Terri Schiavo and theyre like Ah shes been dead for 20 years. Take her water away. The Republicans are like Ah shes a couple of Pilates classes away from you know joining the Rockettes like nobody can agree what reality is. I am so tired of both of these groups.,

 Both.,

 I cannot tell you.,

 Then what is left for you Jon?,

 What is left for me?,

 If youre tired of both groups?,

 Hosting a basic cable show. That is what is left for me sitting every day and getting to rub my eyes and make stupid faces on videotape. That is all that is left for me. That is the catharsis that I live for.,

 So in a sense youre happy over this.,

 No.,

 This gives you fodder.,

 Yes I prefer not the fodder. Im notwere not the guys at the craps table betting against the line. I wouldwed make fun of something else. If public life if government suddenly became inspiring and moved towards peoples better nature and began to solve problems in a rational way rather than just a way that involved political dividends we would be the happiest people in the world to turn our attention to idiots like you know media people no offense.,

 So you dont want it to be bad?,

 Did you really just ask me if I want it to be bad?,

 Yes because you...,

 What are youI have kids what do you think? Yes I dont want them to have any kind of aI want things to corrode to the point where were all living in huts.,

 Not all living in huts but generally comics political comics like things to go a little wrong dont have to be the end of the world.,

 Like things to go a little wrong like birdshot to the face of a guy that will survive.,

 Thats right.,

 Not like things to go wrong until its like Mad Max every man for himself lets all ride around with machineguns on which seems to be the way that its...,

 You dont want Medicare to fail?,

 Are you insane?,

 No.,

 Youre literally asking me if I would preferyes Larry what Im saying to you as a comedian I want old people to suffer old and poor people to suffer. That isthat iswhat we want iswhat seems absurd to me is the length that Washington just seems out of touch with the desires of Americans to be spoken to as though they are adults. I mean when you listen to Bushs speeches and Im leaving the Democrats out because I honestly dont feel that they make an impact. They have 49 percent of the vote and three percent of the power. At a certain point you go Guys pick up your game. But Bush you know the other day when he had the speech about us being addicted to oil he says those things as though you know he just thought of it and were disagreeing with him like everybodys been saying that. Jimmy Carter said it I think in 1978. And he comes out What people dont realize is were addicted to foreign oil and hes saying it like youre going Get out of here. Were addicted. You dont get it people. You know he was the guy on the stump a few years ago making fun of hybrid cars because it wasnt manly.,

 Our guest is Jon...,

 Andand his vice president did shoot a 78-year-old man in the face. Aaron Burr was the last vice president to shoot a guy in the face Alexander Hamilton.,

 And that was a duel.,

 That was a duel based on personal integrity. This vice president thought a 78-year-old man was a bird. It happens. What are you going to do?,

 Weve declined as a society right?,

 I cannot tell you how many times Ill turn around and go Grandpa oh no its a pigeon.,

 Jon Stewart hosts the Academy Awards. You cannot tell...,

 Sunday?,

 ...Sunday what might happen and hes not nervous.,

 I amI amIm excited. I think its going to bewere going to have a lot of fun.,

 Thats Jon Stewart. Hes our special guest live in Los Angeles tonight. He will host the Academy Awards Sunday night. We were talking before we take some calls that basically your schtick is the first ten minutes.,

 First of all dont call it schtick. Thats insulting. Im crafting things from whole cloth comedic bits to raise and lower peoples and to conduct an orchestra of humorous puns and such. Schtick please. Please sir. And schtick is a kinnish. No my friend you and your Yiddish. I wont have it. Mu punim wont pupick.,

 Hi Larry how are you doing tonight? Jon its a pleasure to talk with you. I have a question that refers back to your inference to the American people and how astounded you are that they dont react to the things that the Bush administration has done. Do you think the Dubai incident will incense the people enough to say hey Americans should be the only people protecting America or do you think this will just be another one where they blink and say look at what theyre doing again?,

 First let me ask you a question. What the hell happened to Bode Miller? New Hampshire lady.,

 I think he got a little bit too big for his ski boots.,

 Thank you I appreciate that. Now lets move on to the next thing. What was she saying?,

 The American people they put up with all this.,

 First of all the American people its like saying the media. There is no such thing as the American people. Its a collective ofI mean the whole thing is a melting pot a collecting of individuals. And will this finally push people over the edge to notice? I have no idea. I keep wondering. I keep wondering what it takes to get fired from this administration. It seems like literally the worse you do the bigger the medal you get. Like the more youif you goGeorge Tenet it is a slam-dunk they have weapons of mass destruction. Im sorry. I cant think of a bigger mistake other than you walk in lets say when you had your heart attack and you go in and somebody says you have a broken leg . You had a heart attack. And then you would go doctor you get a medal. Whats a bigger mistake than what he did and he was awarded with the Congressional Medal of Freedom. How does that fit in?,

 Fresno California. Hello.,

 Look at you. Youre beaten.,

 Hello. Good evening Jon. Im crazy about you Jon. Oprah Winfrey said that youre the real deal and I think thats the biggest compliment you can pay. My question was what was it like for you and your wife when Oprah came and spent the afternoon with you?,

 It was excellent. We had a wonderful time with Oprah. And when she left we looked underneath our chair in our living room. New car. Unbelievable. She passes them out like the way that in New York City they slip menus under your door. Literally as she was leaving our building she slipped a new car under everybodys door. Shes like the candy man. I really like what she does. You can be on TV for a long time and lose your mind and it gets relentless. I think her ability to affect things is really kind of a remarkable ,

 She is remarkable.,

usage of your fame and wealth and I get a tremendous kick out of that.,

 Manchester Vermont.,

 A lot of Manchesters tonight.,

 Good evening Larry good evening Jon. My question is about America: The Book.,

 Oh thank you.,

 I teach history in a private school and Im proud to say that I get a little wiggle room with what I use for resources and Im actually going to incorporate a piece of the audio book into my teaching this week. And theres a chapter in the book towards the end about the future. And my question Jon is do you really think its that bleak with the wholewith the indifference of the people and the distraction of the left/right paradigm we live in? And what can we do the people who try to make a difference?,

 First of all sir I love your teaching style. I love the enthusiasm with which you bring forth your love of history. Im sure your students appreciate that as well. Wow! that was all. I didnt hear anything but paradigm. Did you?,

 No.,

 Hes talking about in the book we have a little thing on the future. The first thing I would say to a history teacher is we made half the stuff in that book up. So I would say that first and foremost. That to use any part of it in your class I dont even know if that would be appropriate to use in a fiction class.,

 You even signed it to someone here stupid book.,

 I believe I did say stupid book and I stand by that. Were actually going tothe idea that he would use it in a history class I think is a mistake. Im just saying.,

 What do you think of Anna Nicole Smith? Its before the Supreme Court.,

 What are you doing to me?,

 Shes going to the Supreme Court to attend her hearing.,

 You want me to comment on this administration and now we move on to Anna Nicole Smith. You just gave me a brain fart. I cant move to that. What do I think? How is she getting to the Supreme Court?,

 Shes suing the estate of her ex-husband. Its a bankruptcy case.,

 And thats going to the Supreme Court?,

 You didnt hear this?,

 Im a very busy man.,

 The Supreme Court has agreed to hear it because its a bankruptcy case and therefore it regards the federal law. And its her case. And shes filed a complaint and theyre hearing her complaint. Theyve agreed to hear her complaint. And she is in court for the hearing.,

 We cant straighten out abortion law but they want to sit and have a couple of minutes with Anna Nicole Smith? They want to come in and find outdo you think this is a Trimspa thing? Do you think this is the justices they really want just a couple of minutes to go how did you have lose the weight? I mean look at Stevens over here? Hes a bit of a tub. We talk to him all the time. He goes down to the Supreme Court gym. Can you give us any advice? Anna Nicole Smith is going to the Supreme Court? Shes going to walk into the Supreme Court?,

 Right.,

 Thank God that justice has a blind fold on her eyes because if she were to see that she would weep. If the justice statue saw Anna Nicole Smith she would literally gouge her own eyes out.,

 You did it good. You said why did I go to that segue and you handled it great.,

 Is that true? Im quite good.,

 Youre a comic.,

 Is that so?,

 Yes.,

 Thank you. I should host the Oscars.,

 And he will this Sunday night.,

 Sunday?,

 What do you make by the way before we take the next call of listening in on phone calls for national security without ,

 Well I love the idea when they say if al Qaeda is calling you we want to know. Yes I think that sounds pretty reasonable. The problem is they dont sayagain its like everything else. They say trust us everythings fine. Yet theyve shown no real credibility. Honestly all of this is credibility issues. If they could assure credibility and trust with the people I think the people would be far more willing to trust their secretive nature. But to just come out at this point in the game and go were listening to phone calls but its reallyto tell you about it would put the whole operation in jeopardy the war on terror.,

 Hi. I just have to tell you Jon you are the smartest funniest man on TV and I just go to sleep every night with a smile on my face.,

 Im sitting right next to Larry.,

 My question is does your wife find you hilarious.,

 You know living with someone for ten years the magic of my hilarity wears off.,

 She doesnt laugh?,

 No she does. Shes got a great sense of humor. But you know how it is. Its regular life. We dont sit and do spiel at the table. I say how is Maggie. We talk. But I hope she thinks Im pleasant to be around.,

 Is she out for the awards your wife?,

 No. Shes going to come out right before the show but Im outshes back home.,

 Hows the new baby?,

 Great. Doingshes great. Doesnt say a lot.,

 And does Nathan Thomas who is 19 months old ,

 Hes 19 almost 20 months.,

 Does he like having a little sister?,

 He likes her very much unlesstheres only one thing he doesnt really like and thats if Tracy or I touches her. Or goes near her. Or mentions her name. Or thinks about the baby. Other than that I think hes bearing up very very well. He loves her. He calls her Ghee (ph) and gets very excited. You know whats interesting he is very excited and will run in her room but doesnt know what to do once he gets in there. Then he looks at her and its little and he doesnt know what to do.,

 And its some difference from boys to girls let me tell you.,

 Is that right?,

 Night and day.,

 What would be the difference?,

 Just aint the same.,

 So youre suggesting that boys are different than girls?,

 I am suggesting that. As babies.,

 Interesting. Interesting. Are you suggesting maybe one has I dont know a penis? And the other perhaps not so much?,

 Thats one of the things.,

 Interesting.,

 Hello. I was wondering regarding the cultural war we have between Republicans and Hollywood how Jon feels this years crop of nominees and the films that Hollywood chooses to celebrate is that Hollywood thumbing its nose at Republicans or does it give kind of a vindication to the Republican party and possibly allow some backlash because the Hollywood finding a time of censorship becoming a real issue again could it hurt them?,

 I think thats a good question and its a nice thing for the media to dissect but Im not so sure how real it is. Theres this idea that there are Republicans and Hollywood and theres such a thing as Hollywood and such a thing as Republicans and theyre locked in a culture war. I just dont know what that is. That strikes me as much more of a method for pundits and politicians to whip up excitement and votes and fear than it is a real thing. Hollywood is nottheres this idea that there exists some sort of underground political Hollywood mockenation (ph) machine. Hollywood wantstheyre not red theyre not blue theyre green. They want money. Its a business like any other business. You get aPassion of the Christ went well. Great replace Jesus with a talking lion. Narnia. Done. This idea that theyre thumbing their nose at the country. They wantwhat do you think theyre just putting movies out because they dont want people to go to. Im going to put this out because you know what this is really going to make Iowa mad and I dont want them going anywhere near this thing.,

 Lets check in with Anderson Cooper at the top of the hour.,

 Is he crying again? Did something happen? Now youre just being cruel. Now youre just being cruel.,

 The new movie Doogal in which our guest Jon Stewart plays the evil wizard Zeebad. Jons character Zeebad is now one of McDonalds happy meal toys. So in the same week that he hosts the Oscars hes a happy meals toy. In fact we have it right here. It fell off.,

 Boy if that isnt a metaphor for whats going down with that flick.,

 There it is folks.,

 I think it goes the other way.,

 Fix it. Fix Zeebad.,

 All right. Here you go. What you do is you do this you twist it up and then you go and then you stare at it and think about your own sadness.,

 Did you like doing that?,

 Did I? Like?,

 Like.,

 Its easy. You know you go into a room and they put lines in front of you and you read it. And then after you read a line theyll come out and go can you sound angry on that one? And then you do it again and then they go yeah that sounded kind of angry.,

 Did you see a picture of the character you were playing?,

 No I did not. It was a movie already. It was a movie in England. I was under the impression that this was a foreign film that we were sort of redoing in an American version.,

 It was a movie?,

 Right. But it was called The Magic Roundabout I think and it was a British film. So there actuallyit was already in English just with British accents. So what they did is they got American actors to then do and like put in pop culture references for America. It is in no way a cynical undertaking to make money. Its an art form. I think this is going to be the new wave. I think theyre going to nowyoure going to see Toy Story redone in England with British people and...,

 Do you know that next year you might be nominated?,

 I can assure you Larryand I feel pretty confident in saying thisthat next year I will not be nominated except for perhaps a Razzie. But I really dont feel that an Oscar. Maybein fact I can almost confidently state that...,

 Goldie Hawn told us the other night that you were terrific in First Wives Club and they cut you out.,

 Yes. I was so good that they felt it would shame the rest of the movie to have my scenes in it. Yes it wasI wasI played her boyfriend and apparently they felt that that was not inherently part of the storyline.,

 Yes.,

 And so she broke up with me before the movie started. So my role was not there.,

 Kaput. Were you downtrodden? Were you hurt?,

 I really feel like I have gotten to this weird place where rejection like or bombing or things like that is kind of like its a good kind of pain. Like you get a shot to the ribs sometimes and you go eh Im alive you know what I mean? Like it doesntit doesntyou get to a certain baseline where you feel confident in your ability to do that tiny little thing that you do. And the other stuff that youve been allowed to do is sort of gravy and if it doesnt work out thats really all right.,

 Yes.,

 Most people dont realize you have legs.,

 Thats right. They only see me sitting.,

 Id always assumed that for the past 10 years they just brought you in on some sort of cart. And it was just from here on up and the rest of it is just some sort of auger-based fluid thing that was keeping you going. So to see you move like that is reallyit was quite impressive.,

 So that was the moment of zen.,

 That was our moment of zen.,

 Should I look at it as having made it?,

 No you should look at it as something denigrating and absolutely beneath your status as an icon. Now did thatwas that enjoyable? You really have some moves there.,

 Yeah I did. I enjoyed it.,

 Do you know how to dance? Do you know how to do any of those like cha-cha or any of that kind of stuff?,

 Not really. Im faking it.,

 Are you really?,

 Yeah. I mean Im doing moves but I dont know what Im doing.,

 What about joining that show? What about doing Dancing With the Stars or Skating With the Stars or Quail Hunting with the Stars whatever the next thing is going to be?,

 I dont think I could handle that.,

 Heres what I want to see. Heart Surgery With the Stars. Just put a guy out there maybe a guy you used to see on TV in the 70s that you love and Eric Estradalet them work with a cardiologist. Let them go in there doyou know how many people would tune in to see the guy from Chips do a heart transplant?,

 Thank you Jon. Good luck Sunday.,

 Sunday?,

 Sunday!,

 Im excited. Its always fun to be here.,

 This album um—like when I when I first heard it and the more I hear it I feel like the only like appropriate question to ask you after listening to it is are you okay? Like is something wrong? Like like its like gut-wrenching. Its both beautiful—its very beautiful—but its like parts that hurt a little bit you know what I mean?,

 Yeah its—man I was like... Cause for Cherry Bomb I purposely was like I dont wanna get personal at all. Like Imma just make songs. This is all just this is a song. And in this one I was like Alright let me write down every feeling.,

 Oh you started with emotions?,

 Just—just a lot of them was just asking questions. A lot of the songs just have questions its just like How am I feeling today? Fuck what if I go poor again? What if it doesnt work? And then thats how a lot of the songs just happened just me kind of just asking these quest—answering these questions like so...,

 But its speaking to like a mood you were in. Like—like you recorded this one when did you...,

 Um mostly 2016—like I started to the end of 2015. A lot of spring summer 2016 and then a lot of fall,

 What were you listening to? Like—,

 Um...,

 Like watching and listening to?,

 Pop music. I love—I was like listening to pop structure. Uh kinda just what like Max Martin was doing and really getting into what what Pharrell and Justin was doing—,

 Yeah...,

 And um just noticing just hooks. I uh—hanging out with Travis Taco. I went to the club with him and just seeing what people how people reacted to certain—,

 You never go to clubs!,

 I hate em. But when I would go I would just study Oh that that bass drop or Oh that girl loves that part. Just like Okay I want to have a song that has that feeling. So I kind of was like okay. I wanna see—challenge myself and try to make a few songs thats not like Uh rappity-rappy or super distorted I was like... Last night I went to—me and Lionel went to like a house party and they they all the songs they were playing—Señiorita by Justin Tell Me by Total Frontin by P—like all these house partying songs. And See You Again came on and its full of black people that for sure go to clubs and they were in there like singing the lyrics and I was like Oh shit Ive always wanted that.,

 To just have black people... dance...,

 I I did it. Yeah yeah! I was so hyped and I was—we were playing Jenga and I was being cool about it but inside I was like Oh shit—,

 You were going crazy—,

 I finally have something that they could do that to,

 Its funny because I guess I wouldnt have uh like thought about how much like pop is you know influenced in the album because because of like the subject matter. Like a lot of it is so heavy. Thats why I was just wondering were you in like a place of just like...?,

 Well uh you gotta feed you put the—some people old people say you put the medicine in like the uh the candy—,

 The applesauce,

 —Or the applesauce whatever so... Like with Mr. Lonely I was like Aw dude I want to write the saddest song I could possibly write and see people go crazy and like dance to it its that. And at shows that song is insane and its the saddest song Ive ever wrote,

 Yeah it really is—and you dance—I mean its so hard its so hard and like the greatest like bridge ever! What was that—what was that? I dont know if we—I mean Im just gonna kind of jump into various songs—but like what what was like specifically that like... why that transition? Like why did you think that was like needed a transit—like was it like it for emotional like were you trying to create different moods?,

 So 911 and Mr. Lonely originally was uh a different song kind of together. It was this jazz take I had that was super triumphant and just sounded grand and a lot of those lyrics was uh... was in that song and I just took em and just placed them on 911 and then took the verse and placed it on Mr. Lonely and added some stuff. And 911—the version that came out is the 25th version it had...,

 Wait the 25th version? You did 25 versions of that song?,

 It was 24. The first version was over an interlude song that Tony Toni Toné had. I looped it sang over that liked the hook that I put there made 30 beats for it. Its—and the versions arent just different type of lyrics its literally like... different beats different melodies all that,

 A completely different vibe?,

 Made that took the beat from the fashion show I did reworked that. Took the lyrics from the original Mr. Lonely and like implementing it in that and like so the original Mr. Lonely its like uh...,

 Yeah yeah...,

 Right yeah. Thats in the last version of 911...,

 So you kept that based on the previous you just-,

 Exactly so I took it from this jazz song and I was like nah I want them to groove to this shit so I put it on that,

 I actually always wondered why that bit repeat-,

 Well yeah it just cause it was from it was it was from the bass of the other one but when I put it there and drop the beat people I was like oh people are gonna love saying this. And if you see that shows I dont even say it I just put the mic and the whole -ten thousand people:  nothing nothing nothing. And Im like I figured it out and I-,

 You figured out—that that feeling that you want the feeling of just everybody really connecting with it but wait- specifically the bridge on that- what was like-,

 Oh oh what the chirp chirp part?,

 I say bird- but like which is the most one of the most addictive things-,

 I aint made that I remember I made that and it was just the beat and I remember stopping like I made the bridge that Ive always wanted to make. Lonny came by-or Frank however people know him- and he came by and I played it for him hes like you let me go in there Just try something he just started making phone noises and it worked out so perfectly and we was like alright and-,

 was it longer?,

 no that part Im just giving n*ggas eight bars of these chords just so they could want it so they could replay it and left it at that,

 How did you balance out and this is kind of for the whole album your love of chords with-you always talk about and you always say n*ggas dont want chords and thats all youre obsessed with. Its just everything is specific and just-,

 I just Want chords and melodies,

 Yeah. and was it like a battle- cause the whole album has chords,

 Yeah I fucked up-well I didnt fuck up but Cherry Bomb was an album full of bridges and shit going everywhere so I was like let me for this album specifically add all the chords I like but do it in a way that they can digest. So Mr. Lonely has some of the prettiest chords on the album but I kinda hid it behind the hard drums and the fast paced rap but if you really listen its really fucking pretty- Thank you. And I was like Im definitely gonna-just try to hide it in those and stuff. And 911 even the uh call me some time. I was listening to Gap Band and I was like damn these are simple chords and I love the melody let me try to implement it in this and make it as simple as possible but it still gives me that feeling. So the part where I was like fuck it Imma go crazy I right before Steve Lacys part when it goes back to the hook and its like: dun dun dun dun dun and I was like Imma go on my Jill Scott shit and thats my favorite part of that song just cause it just-,

 It has all the chords that you love,

 Exactly,

 Umm do you wanna...,

 You could cut it now,

 I cant even lie... Where does the..,

 I can just imagine a n*gga in a wife-beater on Valentines Day like in the hood and like-,

 Is he talking to his friends or in the mirror-,

 I dont know who hes talking to but its a quick shot like I cant even lie Ive been lonely as fuck n*gga just being honest with his homies or something and I was like man that would be really funny to chant. But its the perfect set up for when that song comes on. It sets you up for like whats bout to happen. Its honest but its right here and they go crazy when they-,

 Its like so sad its hilarious. Its like there a group of n*ggas chanting-,

 And thats Rocky. Thats Rocky yelling that. Thats Q I think thats Wyatt thats Lionel thats Jasper-,

 Alright Foreword is ah- ok first of all that tempo is very weird. Its like a really weird tempo that you found was it kind of just like a challenge?,

 Well so thats a loop from this band called Can. Ive always been into krautrock its like- it was a sound that was very European like Eastern Europe and you got like Can The Silver Apples even Soft Machine which was this really proud jazz band that took influence around that time. And its kind of what Portis Head listens to for influence and its something Ive always liked because its just so weird and just- this weird drum patterns and these haunting bass lines and thats a song that they had and everytime I played it I would just rap over it. And I was like fuck it Imma loop it add these-,

 Is it hard to rap over just the-,

 Not actually Its actually just the one two three four but the pockets that they would use makes its sound like this weird push and pull back thing,

 Yeah it feels like your on something you know what I mean? Just kinda pulls. Yeah and its like- that pocket is such- the pace of it when youre rapping over it is you do a little bit faster than I would expect. Like a little bit more- why why that song first? Why that mood though first? Where you trying to set a-?,

 I remember making it like this need to be the first song. Just go in just so you can see where Im at in my head and I remember writing that verse fully like.... how much shit can I buy till it gets boring like how many jumps can I do on a bike until Im over it and on to the next thing. And every answer that I had went to the next question like was it ever enough.,

 it almost sounded it was so existential and contemplative and it almost sounded suicidal especially the if Im going and dont come back- do you know what I mean? It was so dark its-,

 Yeah yeah yeah. That was the end question like damn what if I died? What happen? And thats kinda what it was and just to set the tone of like thats where Im at. And its not depressed-Im not depressed at all. A lot of people mix up depression with self awareness. Someone was like dude this album is depressing and I was nah I never said I was depressed. Im lonely but Im having the most fun of my goddamn life. But that song kinda sets that tone,

 Ok I mean if youre considering death but its not from a depressed sad state is it from a state of like alright Ive got something to prove cause it almost seems like you had a thing to prove on this album. I dont know to yourself or like-,

 Well a lot of people do stuff for the conversation of when theyre dead. Like hopefully when I die people can say oh he-this this and this I leave a good discography behind but-,

 Yeah I like to start with every project I like to start from death and work backwards,

 Exactly,

 Its just like were all gonna die someday,

 I just knew that if this album wasnt good I would be fucked. Thats how I felt. And some people would disagree but Im like man Im nothing right now,

 You felt like that coming off of Cherry Bomb?,

 Yeah yeah yeah cause everyone hated it except for like real music lovers who care about drums- like I opened a rap album with a rock song. Most n*ggas was like uh. And then Buffalo comes and you can barely hear what Im saying and then Pilot comes on and its this 80s music and theyre out cause they want rap. Then Run comes dun dun and then Find Your Wings comes and theyre like this is chill and then Cherry Bomb comes and just punches them-so theyre out and a lot of people didnt know how to take it so- But Find Your Wings and stuff felt so- I dont even know if I mean lyrically I mean sonically going back to your love of chords and stuff like that and you would on Cherry Bomb it seems like you would have chords and distort it like it was you were always running from it and covering it up so that-saying its your most personal album removed from the subject matter it feels that way like sonically Yeah I fully get that yeah. never thought that,

 It just feels like a real- Okay so the sadness of Foreword that goes into almost the like- Im going to say almost this cockiness of Where This Flower Blooms. Do you feel like you were accepting yourself?,

 So its a lot of things-and I dont wanna take credit-that I was doing that people were like what is he doing and then two years later its what everyones doing whether its the way videos are done or these stupid pop-up things or whatever and Im not taking credit but I was doing that and no-one ever puts me on these lists or respects me in the sense that I wanted. So I was just and thats why that line is like: Aint nobody fucking with T but that just may be my ego but dont be too cool because I may freeze and Im stuck in this egotistical mindset and I never move forward and thats how n*ggas freeze to death but that ice shit weighs a ton water your garden my n*gga and stunt. I got a flower chain made with all these different things and thats what I was talking about but I was like fuck these n*ggas keep doing my shit uh and tell these black kids they can be who they are-,

 Thats one of my favorite lyrics is just tell these black kids they can be who they are,

 Dude right!,

 Like its one of my favorite- you had another lyric like that on Cherry Bomb that was just like the world is yours little n*gga like my little n*gga the world is yours. Like I love that- like its a similar thing like tell these black kids they can be who they are. Where you saying that to you or the people you see...?,

 I was saying that to me to but it uh its no-one saying that to kids that look like me or anyone that looks like me. We had this conversation just wanting to snowboard when I was 12 but someone was like oh thats white people shit. Black people dont do that. No you dont do that dont put a damper on me and tell me what I can a cant be just because of the way everyone else was thats my same color. And I just feel like I just wanted to tell them like be you-,

 Who you are is such the alternative of the expectations are placed on like a young black guy growing up. Like youre influenced by kind of everything kinda all cultures so do you think you accepted that by yourself through your music,

 I knew who I was at like 12,

 I think you rapped maybe 28% on the album. Its like so-,

 My goal for this album was to shut the fuck up and let the all feature be the leader. Yes Rex here sing for two minutes before I come in with an 8 bar on Boredom and then Ill have another 8 bar but I wanna shut up and just let the string section be 2 minutes at the end.,

 Boredom I think-I found out about it this morning- Boredom right now to me is like your Billy Jean.,

 Really?,

 It really is kind of a- seeing people connect with that song... That song influenced... I think I called you and said if I dont know this song is creating an emotion for me or if its like the soundtrack to something I already feel. Like thats how powerful I think it is,

 Well I wrote that literally it was a 5 pm on a Saturday laying on my back looking so bored. It was nothing to do no-one was hitting me back Jasper was in the other room bored out of his mind but I didnt see him the whole day my room was warm as hell because I like the heater on and there was nothing to eat but dry cereal and Im sitting thinking what the fuck am I going to do? I literally wrote that verse in 10 seconds cause again it was these questions and these legit feelings of boredom that I was having. And it was weird to me cause its like... Im in a tax bracket where I can go do whatever. I have all these cars I can go drivebut I have nowhere to go and Im just bored. And it was just confusing to me cause its like-,

 You dont understand how you could possibly,

 How the hell I could be bored when its... but there was nothing to do at the moment. So I was like fuck it Im gonna write a song about it,

 Jasper has to listen to that song and be like fuck you n*gga I was right there,

 I wrote the song over the chords of God Bless the Child by Stevie Wonder. I figured out the chords looped it and had it just playing for hours in my room. And I wrote the verse which was like a 40 bar verse originally but I cut it in half cause I was like the hook needs to come back. So at the end of the first verse its like Im... bored. I did that right when we was editing cause it went to the end of the verse it was like originally Im bored and getting desperate. Phone is not It went straight to a different verse and it was a different pocket but I cut it because I was like I need to put the hook back in here cause I dont wanna hear myself,

 Yeah cause its a weird chunk just Im... bored. Find some time!,

 Uh huh. So I added that right when we was editing finishing I was like No no no fuck that put the hook. Imma change the second verse a little bit and like so the pocket is easier to rap so everyone could say it. Cause it was too rapitty you know and I was like nobody wanna hear this deep ass voice rap for that long; let me shut the fuck up and do a hook so all the white girls at Coachella can sing this shit And Im not lying doing festivals you realize white people love singing along to shit Thats why the fucking Boredom is two minutes of just this like...,

 When you perform this album live you start on Where This Flower Blooms usually. Is it a longer intro?,

 Yeah yeah yeah so... I wanted this album to sound like a Disney score. Just like very magical. My perfect little indie movie and fucking...,

 Sound like the album cover looks,

 Yeah sound like the album cover looks like. But it turned into you know what it turned into. Where This Flower Blooms had this very beautiful longer intro I shortened it a bit but it sound like the beginning of a movie,

 Its sweeping and...,

 Yeah I start the shows with that because its like bringing them into my world and then it drops and gets crazy but... yeah,

 How long did you why did you trim it and not just go-,

 I just wanted to cut the fucking fat. I wanted this album to be no longer that 45 minutes. And I think we hit 45:36 or 46 minutes and I was like okay cool. I just want it to be short and get to the point and yeah,

 You were talking about questions and how every song is sparked by a... thing. [stammering] My favourite sequence of this of these songs but... uh Pothole is inspired by something your mom said to you. Is that like...,

 A long time ago she was like yo some people just arent really as loyal or close to you as you think. And Im always like shut the fuck up like what the fuck are you talking about? Sometimes moms know best and I had to find out on my own like oh wow she wasnt wrong about that person. And I kind of wrote that verse like: My mom told me blah blah blah. And uh...,

 So you singing that more? You started singing that more,

 Yeah and even like I did it in the car like I drove back to the points where she told me specifically. Like when you make three lefts it makes it right. So like I triple left tryna double back. And the streets are filled with clues that she told me,

 And thats great that some of your best,

 But how I aint notice that. And I see some familiars I see some people I knew stuck in the cul-de-sac. I pull up get out what up I wanna help you. But what you want for some people they dont want for themselves. So do I stay here and try to figure it out or do I go and traffic is picking up? And if I dont leave now and get on my path and do what I need to do Imma be stuck and,

 Were having a lot of fun with Snoop Dogg tonight. What a great guest to kick into the weekend. What a talent too and what a good guy. Hes a good guy the Snoopthe Snoopster.,

 Larry I want to give you something here my new headphones. You know I make headphones too? These are the by Snoop Dogg so whenever you listen to that Frank Sinatra and Sam Cooke you can enjoy your music heavily.,

 Yes.,

 Thank you Snoop.,

 Well thank you.,

 I love this. I like the design too.,

 Yes sir. Thats,

 Whats with you and the Los Angeles Lakers?,

 Ive been a Lakers fan since the early 70s. I grew up loving Magic Johnson Kareem Abdul Jabbar and Chick Hearn. I had a chance to meet Chick Hearn ,

 A great announcer.,

and to work with Chick Hearn and I mean Im just a die hard Laker. I love them to death. They cant do no wrong to me.,

 You go to every game?,

 I go to as many games as I can when Im in town. I just love to support them. If Im not at the game Im at home watching them on Prime Ticket you understand? Well either watch them on Channel 9 KCAL.,

 Do you ever go on the road with them?,

 Ive been on the road with them before. When they won their championship in New Jersey I was right there on the floor when they did that.,

 Did you ever play ball?,

 I played football and basketball as a youngster coming up on the east side of Long Beach. And I took it to a level that I thought itit was the highest level that I thought I could take it to. So I never wanted to play high school or the next level. I went to the level that I thought I was just playing.,

 Did you go to a high school?,

 I went to high school but I didntI didnt never try out for high school sports. I was more into trying to create this music thing. I had aa niche for it and I really wanted to stick to it.,

 You were always a music guy?,

 Always a music guy/comedian/class clown.,

 Why the sunglasses?,

 So you can see what Im saying. But I mean I can take them off.,

 Well yes but its part of your persona right?,

 At times.,

 Do you design those too?,

 Yes you know I got to have my flavor. You see that matchbook with the headphones? Thats that flavor that paisley.,

 Oh yes yes the paisley stuff.,

 Yes thats what I do. Thats that Snoop Dogg flavor Larry.,

 What dontwhat have we donewhat havent you done youd like to do?,

 Id like to start a chain of Snooper-markets.,

 Selling what?,

 Every ,

 Groceries?,

 Yes groceries. Anythingeverything in my store would be under 20 dollars. There would be nothing in there over 20 dollars.,

 Clothes too?,

 Everything under 20 dollars.,

 Snooper-markets?,

 Yes.,

 Well have you talked to people about it?,

 Im talking to them right now.,

 Not bad.,

 I mean you hear them talking back?,

 What did you make about Michael Jackson passing?,

 I was ,

 Did you know Michael?,

 Yes I knew Michael Jackson. Im a close friend of the family. I love Michael Jackson and what he done for music what he done for life and Im justyou know Im just a fan you know? So I love everything that he done. He could never do no wrong in my eyes. I mean I love the music that he made the spirit that he brought just showing people how to love and how to reach out and then give back because thats what he did with most of his time and his money. It was spent on giving back. He was never about himself. He was always about others.,

 How did Dr. Dre find you?,

 His brother half-brother Warren G. Was in my group 213me him and Nate Dogg. And we had a cassette tape and Warren G took it to Dr. Dres bachelor party. And the music had cut off from the bachelor party. So he slipped my tape in and when my tape came in people was dancing to it. And Dre was like who was that? He was like thats my homeboy Snoop. He introduced me to him and the rest is history.,

 Back with our remaining moments with Snoop Dogg. And we are joined by his son Corde. Is this the oldest boy?,

 Yes.,

 Its a great pleasure to welcome to Larry King Live as always a good friend old friend the vice president of the United States Joe Biden. Thanks for coming in.,

 Yeah its great to be back with you Larry.,

 Its always good. This is like the hundredth time.,

 Well Ill tell you what ,

 Senator ,

I dont know. Its a long time. But Ill tell you what. I told you this before my mother who lived with me passed away last January. I never once walked in her house late in the evening that you werent on the air. And so II miss her and Im really going to miss you man. The country is going to miss you doing this.,

 All right lets get into things. Early today ObamaPresident Obamamade you the focus on getting this treaty signed.,

 Yes.,

 Whats holdingyou know no DemocratIm told today no Democratic president ever had a nuclear treaty.,

 Well thats true. And thats why this idea that somehow that some Republicans arepundits are talking about you cant let Obama have a win. This is not an Obama win. This is a continuation of aof a bipartisan policy. It started with Ronald Reagan in this case. Its critically important to our national security interests. And I think were going to get it passed. I still think were going to get it passed. And what the president ,

 You have to get Republicans to come over dont you?,

 Yes we have to get eight Republicans to vote with us beyond Dick Lugar. Dick Lugar is as you know the single most informed guy probably in either political party on the issue of nuclear weapons and arms control. And he is passionate about it. I met today Larry withwe have five former Republican secretaries of state who think this is essential. Former Republican secretaries of defense national security advisers. And so ,

 So why are they fighting you?,

 Well wewe actually havent laid the treaty down yet. Weve been working very closely with a very bright guy John Kyl a Republican whos their point man on the details of the treaty.,

 But hedidnt he announce he was against it?,

 Well no but he announced that he didnt think there was enough time to consider it in a lame duck session. But the president has made clear today to the congressional leadership and he made clear to theto the outside experts these Republican secretaries of State and Defense et cetera that this is his highest priority.,

 But if youre the point man that means what?,

 Well that means ,

 You have to round up the eight guys?,

 Well noyes I do. But beyond that Larry you know Ive spent the bulk of my adult life dealing with strategic doctrine that is things relating to nuclear weapons. From the time I was a young man at age 30 its something Iat least Im informed a great deal about. People notmay not think Im right but I think the vast majority of the informed community in terms of national strategic doctrine knows that this is something that inas my brother would say in my wheelhouse. And soand I still have great relationships in the United States Senate. So the president asked me to coordinate the efforts of the State Department of the Defense Department the intelligence community and making the best case possible to the United States Senate something I spent a lot of years trying to do.,

 So youre going to get it?,

 I think were going to get it.,

 OK. Lets go to other things. Waswas the term shellacking correct as to what happened to you ,

 Well yes look ,

and the guys?,

 Look ,

 And the ladies?,

 Look we lost thethe House as big as we had won itbigger than we had won it. And we hung on to the Senate. But Ias I was saying briefly coming in if you take a look at where the unemployment rates were the highest across the country and the districts you just tack on a R as opposed to a D in most of those districts. Its awful hard to win elections when theres 9.5 unemployment 9.6 9.7 percent unemployment. And so it was a real loss. But whatthere was a real message sent. The message was they didnt have a lot of faith in Republican Party and they dont have a lot of faith in the Democratic Party. And so theyre saying OK we want you guys to work together.,

 But shouldnt frankly you have focused on jobs before the health bill?,

 Well look ,

 In retrospect.,

 In retrospect that can be argued and some argued that beforehand. The idea that we werent focusing on jobs while we were focusing on health care is not accurate but when you turn on the television every day for a year and its just health care all the work were doing on creating jobs and dealing with trade and all those issues they justits not anybodyIm not complaining Im just stating the fact that it just has not surfaced. And thats why youre going to see for the next two years all were about is American competitiveness Americanmade in America and American jobs. And we need to cooperate Democrats and Republicans.,

 Should frankly the president have been doing a better job in the area of what iswhat weyou know whats reality and whats perception?,

 Well look ,

 Did he do a poor job in perception?,

 Look I dont think hehe didnt misunderstand at all the dilemma we faced. But he knew for example thatagain this isits our responsibility. So this is notits not the other guy.,

 The buck stops.,

 The buck stops with us. It actually stops with the president hes the guy that makes the final decision God love him. But heres the deal. We found ourselves in the position where the banks were collapsing so we have to make sure that the financial markets were stabilizedone of the most unpopular things you could possibly do. Itd bewould have been easier to pass through the Senate and the House a resolution saying protect rattlesnakes you know? I mean they didnt want toyou know I understand that. And then we believed we had to deal with long-term debt and the biggestthe biggest driver of long-term debt is health care costs. And thats the unspoken part about the health care bill we passed. Its about the gigantic savings long term in terms of federal spending on health care. But again we ,

 But does it ,

 We could have done a lot of things better in retrospect.,

 Including perception right?,

 Including perception. But weve learned from where we are and were determined to take advantage of those lessons and notyou know have the perception clearly focused.,

 Whats behind the postponement of the Slurpee Summit?,

 Oh well look theres a whole lot there. Look the truth of the matter is I met with Mitch McConnell Ive talked with John Boehner when I called to congratulate him. These guys want to meet and ,

 So?,

 And so its wenow the 30th. It was never nailed down finally for lastthis Thursday and I think its a much ado being made about not much at all. Were going to be meeting on the 30th the president and I and the leadership.,

 Who else? All the leaders?,

 No. Well the Republican leadership its going to be the House and Senate Republican leadership. I assume that will include the number two and number three in the House and the Senate. But mainly its John Boehner and it is Mitch McConnell. And look I know both these guys. I work with them. I get along well with them. I think there ought to be places where we can agree. And the most important thing we can agree on is how to grow the economy.,

 And well be right back with the vice president of the United States. His wifes going to join us later will particularly improve this set. Dont go away.,

 Thats cute.,

 Were back with the vice president of the United States. Nancy Pelosi is coming back this time as minority leader. She was a lightning rod youve got to admit that.,

 Oh yes. When you spend 65000$65 million to make someone a lightning rod it works. I go back far enough. You and I remember when Tip ONeill was made the lightning rod. Remember that off-year race with Reagan?,

 Sure do.,

 But look she also is the most effective person in generating results in the House. The House members decided she was the one that she ,

 But people either like her or dont like her.,

 Well you know ,

 Shes not a halfway.,

 I think thats the case with almost all great leaders. People either are going to like Ronald Reagan or didnt like him. They liked George Bush or didnt. They liked Bill Clinton or didnt.,

 Do you think Pelosi is a great leader?,

 Well I think she is. I think shes a very very effective and competent person. She gets things done. And its easy toyou know in this environment toyou know to characterize someone. Again if you notice the thing I love about her never complain and never explain my dads notion. This is one tough smart lady. Lets get to business lets move on now lets see what we can get done.,

 All right. Now are you going to extend the Bush tax cuts ,

 Well look I tell you ,

for all the rich folk?,

 Nono. Let me tell you what our position is. Our position is we want to permanently extend the tax cuts for middle class people for the top 98 percent of the wage earners in Americaor the 98 percent of the wage earners in America. We dont think we can afford to extend permanently the tax cuts for the top two percent. That would blow another $700 billion hole in the budget. And so our position is permanent for the middle class and not permanent for the top.,

 But temporarily?,

 Were going to be sitting downwere going to be sitting down on the 30th with the Republicansthe Republican leadership say guys heres our position whats yours and lets see if we can work something out. Were not looking for confrontation. We know if we dont extend the tax cuts for the middle class not only is it notis it unfair but it will have just an incredible drag on the economy.,

 But you dont want to lose your left do you?,

 No we dont want to lose our left. But look what we want to do basically is whats right right for the country. And whats right for the country is both in terms of fairness and economic growth is giving the middle class whos been batteredfrom 2001 to 2008 they lost five percent of their worth five percent of their income. And you know I dont want to take away from them now. Look a family of four making 50000 bucks Larry a man and a woman they get a $2100 tax break now. Ifput it another way if you dont extend it their taxes go up $2100. $2100 for a family of four means the difference between if they can pay their automobile insurance to drive their automobiles to work if they have a job. A family of four making 100000 grand thats $4100. Thats a difference where they can keep two kids in school and particularly if ones a private institution. So this matters to people who make less than $250000.,

 Lets touchwere going to touch some bases here.,

 Sure absolutely.,

 I mean youre here right?,

 I got you. Fire away.,

 Im leaving soon.,

 Im going with you.,

 We both go out on a sinking ship.,

 Thats right.,

 All right. What do you make of the Charlie Rangel matter?,

 Well you know I ,

 Is he a friend?,

 He is a friend. I give you my word I dont know the detail the charges but when the Ethics Committee runa bipartisan committee rules that he violated X number of rules of the House then you know its hard to argue against. I think the rules apply and they apply but I dont know the details. I really dont.,

 They dont put him out though do they?,

 I hope not. I dont think so. But I dont know enoughI give you my word I dont know enough about the specifics of each of the rulings.,

 OK. All right. TheSarah Palin has apparently now confirmed that shes thinking about running for president. How does that make Joe Biden think?,

 Well youIlook I think Sarah Palin has turned out to be and she is a real force in the Republican Party. And I think Sarah Palin isIwere I a Republican senator or a Republican political leader I would look and say wait shes got a good chance of getting the nomination. But look its hard enough for us to figure our side of the aisle let alone go over and sort of handicap whether she can win or lose.,

 What do you think of her?,

 Well I like her.,

 You do?,

 I meanno no I personally like her. I mean if you met her shes an appealing person. When we campaigned ,

 You debated her.,

 Yes we debated. There was not a harsh word. I mean we have a fundamentally different outlook on the world and I think that would be a really a really interesting race.,

 Would that be a race youd like to take on?,

 Well you know my mom used to have an expression be careful what you wish for Joe you may get it. So I never underestimate anyone. Andbut I think in that race it would be a clear clear choice for the country to make and I believe President Obama would be in very good shape.,

 The White House shot down the rumors that you and Hillary Clinton were going to do a switch.,

 I tried but it didnt work. No. I ,

 Because you wanted State didnt you?,

 No no no.,

 No? OK. All right.,

 No no. Look heres the dealthe president and I there was never any serious talk ever that anyone ever heard about me not being on the ticket with him or her not staying at State.,

 Woodward started it though.,

 Well if you look ateven Bob backed off a little bit on that as hewhat he said is I readand I read his book. What he basically said was when she was being considered for secretary of State it was suggested by one of her pollsters she should take it because maybe there would be the opportunity to be vice president. Hillary has made it clear right from the first time I came out Joe I dont want to be vice president. The president has made it clear Joe I expect you to be on the ticket. I want you on the ticket. So it was really kind ofyou know sort of a Washington parlor game. 

 Moremore with the vice president of the United States right after this. Were back with Joe Biden the vice president. The former Guantanamo detainee is tried on ain a civilian court. Hes acquitted on all but one of 280 charges. The other side says he should have been found guilty on all of them. One side said though if its a result of terror you cant introduce it in court. Where do you stand?,

 Well if its a result of torture ,

 Torture Im sorry.,

 Look the fact of the matter is whats going to happen to him hes going to go to jail for a minimum of 20 years to life. Had he been tried in a tribunal which some of the critics say he should have been tried in a military tribunal the same evidenceand they voted for the change in the rule of the tribunal the same evidence would have been inadmissible. If we held them as some have suggested on the right just held them indefinitely as aas abasically a detainee a prisoner of war the idea that Guantanamo is going to be around in 50 years and him still in jail withI think our bets are better. This proves what exactly what George Bush did. When you go to so-called Article 3 courts that is try in federal courts all this stuff was you cant try them in federal courts youve got to worry about terrorists attacking the court. You cant try him in federal courts theyre not going to get sentenced. Hes getting a longer sentence. Hell be in jail longer than if any other method were tried. Same thing George Bush did with the shoe bomber. Same thing he did with the 24th hijacker.,

 So youre saying in the future with others you would go civilian court?,

 Yes. Theres no reason not to go with civilian court based on this case at least.,

 OK. In week one of the administration your president signed an executive order requiring the Gitmo detention facility closed within a year.,

 Yes.,

 Still there.,

 Still there.,

 Why?,

 Because what we found out when we got in there is theres an awful lot of very tough cases that present real real difficult situations. And so we stillour intention is still to close it. But ,

 But?,

 But we could not meet that within a year.,

 Spoke to soon?,

 Wellthe answerI speak for myself. I spoke too soon because quite frankly we didnt have all the detailed data on every single prisoner the status of that prisoner what that prisoners circumstance was whether we could move them into an Article 3 court whether they should be released et cetera or whether they should be tried in a military court. Thats the process. Its being whittled down until we get down to the point where were able to deal with having to either transfer move try or release. AndI knoweveryone thats in thatin that prison system.,

 Well are you saying its going to be around a while?,

 Well I dont know how much longer its going to be around but Iwhat I am saying the rest of the world understands were making a good faith effort to deal with it and it has helped us a great deal in our overall war against terror. If you notice theyre no longer using the argument that was being used three years ago that you know Americans dont mean what they say about civil liberties Americans dont meanwere getting overwhelming cooperation now from not only ourand Im deeply involved in this piecenot only from our European friends but were also getting overwhelming cooperation from Muslim states. And you know states where there iswhere al Qaeda is trying to burrow in and reside.,

 Wouldnt it have been politically smart franklyyoure an old they dont come on the older hands than Joe Biden. Politically smart for you to announce tonight that in the future these kind of trials like Khalid Sheikh Mohammed thats going to go to a military court? That that would be a plus politically?,

 Well itIit would be a plus politically for people who didnt focus on it. But the example I just gave you the trial we just had. We are going to put this guy in jail longer than he ever would be had he gone to a military court. And what we want to show to the world is were not afraid of putting our criminal justice system for the whole world to see. There is no reason that we are a nation of laws and we can accomplish our end of taking these very bad guys off the street for a long long long time if not forever.,

 Joe Biden is our guest. Hes been the point man on Iraq. What is your assessment of how that country is doing?,

 Its doingits doing very very well. Heres the deal. It took them a long time to form a government because it was a close election. They have now formed a government that reflectsonly demand I made and Ive been on the phone Ior Ive been there six times since weve been elected. I know every one of these Iraqi leaders by their first names I know their children. I mean I know them. Weve been deeply involved. Weve a great ambassador and general over there in General Austin. And weve been deeply deeply involved in helping them facilitate thea government that reflects the outcome of the election. You know they always say Larry that in a new democracy the most important elections the second one. A lot of them have a first one but they dont have a second one. And whats happened now is that weretheres a real power sharing arrangement underneathwithin the context of their constitution. We have kept our commitment. We said wed end this war responsibly. We got all the troops out of the cities last summer. We brought home 100000 troops that we promised this summer. And were going to be out of there by the end of 2011 and were going to leave behind a stable government because the Iraqis stepped up to the ball. Politics broke out in Iraq.,

 Were with Vice President Joe Biden. This is hisget this49th appearance on Larry King Live.,

 Its been an honor.,

 And weve been on the air 25 1/2 years thats two a year. OK. With those specialsmaybe well do a special on the Joe Biden I know.,

 I want to be honest with you.,

 OK Afghanistan. A lot of Americans say leave.,

 Well I dont blame them for wanting to say that. Look here are the facts in Afghanistan. We inherited a war that had been neglected for eight years. Neglected. The first thing the president asked me to do after we got elected before we got sworn in he said Joe I want you to go to Afghanistan give me an independent assessment of what you think we should do come back and report. I used to be Chairman of Foreign Relations. I came back and I said Mr. President you ask 10 of our combatant commanders you ask 10 of our civilians why they think were there you get 10 different answers. There is no clear rationale why were there. So we sat down and I recommended and he then added to it the notion that wewhy are we there? Were there to make sure al Qaeda isis degraded and ultimately defeated. What we calleverybody now calls al Qaeda central in those mountains in Pakistan and Afghanistan that they cannot return and use Afghanistan as a platform. Number two we give the freely elected government an opportunity to be able to protect itself against itsagainst the Taliban and any other interests that it cant reconcile with. And were going to train up their forces. And heres what we said. We said were going to add additional resources to get that done. Were going to begin to transition our military out of IraqI mean excuse me Afghanistan in the summerthis coming summer. And now all of NATOthe president is about to head off to meet with NATO all ,

 In Lisbon right?,

 In Lisbon. All of NATO has said look we agree withwere going to begin to transition and by 2014 its theirs to take care of themselves in terms of their own security.,

 And Americans might say but how many die before 2014?,

 Well unfortunately if one dies its one too many. I had a son who spent a year in Iraq. And every single day I got up and every single day having been to Iraq 17 or 18 times it was on my mind. And I wouldId walk in Larry and I swear to God ininto the kitchen while Jill was getting coffee and making toast and shed be mouthing a prayer. Every minute if you have a husband wife son daughter there every minute its on your mind. But heres the deal this is what we inherited and we had to finish it. Were making significant progress against al Qaeda. It has been significantly diminished in that so-called al Qaeda Central. And at the same time we are moving into a new position where were not going to need American forces in those 34 provinces protecting the Afghani people. Theyre going to begin to do that themselves. And our NATO allies believe we can begin to transition some of those 34 provinces beginning in January.,

 Do you have faith in President Karzai?,

 Look I knowIve known President Karzai for a long long time. I think hes in a very difficult position. I haveyou know we could argue that there could be a stronger leader but you deal with the hand youre dealt as the old saying goes. And we are all on the same page now for the first timethe American military the American civilians the administration the Congress the NATO our allies the Afghanis that heres the deal youve got to step up your governance capability. Were going to help train your folks. Youve got to step upwe cannot want peace and security more than you want it in your villages and in your homes. Were going to help train you. In the meantime weve said aand you know a lot ofa lot of our critics say you shouldnt set a deadline to get out. The reason we needed to do that is the same reason we did in it in Afghanistan. We had to say look youve got to step up man. Let me tell you were going to startdaddy is going to start to take the training wheels off in OctoberI mean in next July so youd better practice riding.,

 The wife will be joining us shortly. But one other thing I want to cover before she does join us and thats Dont Ask Dont Tell.,

 Yes.,

 You were against it as I understand?,

 I am.,

 Certainly the president is against it.,

 Yes.,

 Most of the administration is against it. Apparently they polled troops theyre against it. And you poll America and theyre against it. So why is this our policy?,

 It is notit islook Larry this is complicated for people to understand and I dont blame them.,

 Simplify it.,

 Simplified as easy as I can say it is Congress passed a policy it has not repealed yet.,

 But the president could sign it away couldnt he?,

 No the president couldntcannot sign it away. What the president can theoretically do is tell the Justice Department to breach what is the understanding that all Justice Departments have. Justice Departments are obliged to defend laws constitutionally passed by the U.S. Congress and signed by former presidents.,

 So they attorney general ,

 So ,

has to defend it for now?,

 He has to defend it for now. We are pushing it as hard as we can. We just had a meeting today with the leadership in the Congress saying we very much would like to see you pass legislation now saying end Dont Ask Dont Tell.,

 Dick Cheneynot Dick Cheney Im sorry. Colin Powell was here the other night.,

 Yes.,

 And,

 A good guy.,

said that he supports John McCain in this matter. Lets wait until we do the whole investigation by the military. Lets wait until we hear from everybody dont rush it.,

 Well ,

 Do you agree with that?,

 Were going to see that very very shortly. Theres going to be a report early in December coming from the Defense Department andon their recommendation. So as my grand papa used to say with the grace of God and the goodwill of the neighbors theyll be a confluence of the two.,

 Do you think well see the end of it by the end of the year?,

 I hope so. I hope so.,

 Were back. Hes been on 49 times over the years. This is her first appearance. Dr. Jill Biden who taught three classes today at her school. She is of course Mrs.what are you Mrs. First Lady? What do they call you Second Lady?,

 Second Lady second lady.,

 Second lady.,

 Or captain of the vice team.,

 Has he changed?,

 Oh no he hasnt changed.,

 I mean now hes vice president. Has he changed?,

 No I dont think. Not at all.,

 You say that you love her more than she loves you.,

 Everybody knows that.,

 You think so?,

 Probably. Oh God.,

 You stillyou taught three classes.,

 I did yes.,

 You teach?,

 I teach writing. I teach English at Northern Virginia Community College.,

 Why do you continue to work? 

 Well its what I do. You know Ive been an English teacher for 30 years and its what I love. And when we were elected I said to Joe Im going to continue to teach. And he saidAnd I strongly encouraged her. Yes. Look I think its really important that someone in Jills position as second lady or the wife of an elected official if they want to has their own separate sphere and their ownand shes deeply involved in matters relating to the White House. And besides she loves it. I dont knowAnd hes always been supportive of my career and whatever I do.,

 Were you teaching when you met?,

 Yes. Yes I was. I was teaching.,

 Always at the junior college ,

 No I taught high school for 13 years actually.,

 Why do you like teaching so much?,

 Well I think especially at the community college I think I do make a difference in their lives. You know theyre working theyre going to school theyre raising families.,

 Are they 18 19 20?,

 Orno theyre all ages. So actually I think 26 is like the average age of a community college student. And I think I make a difference. I can make a difference.,

 I see you a lot with Michelle Obama.,

 Right yes.,

 PSAs public service announcements. How do you two really get along?,

 We really like one another. And I think from the very beginning when we got together I think you know fate brought us together. And she had her projects that she was interested in and I had mine but the one thing that we came together was military families. And so thats what were working on together and we have a lot of fun together.,

 We just heard your husband talk about Iraq and Afghanistan. Now you talk to military families right? ,

 I do.,

 Wives husbands children.,

 Children yes.,

 We know we always hear about the military families who say we support them. Do you hear from people who say we dont support them?,

 Never.,

 They dont say ,

 Not from Americans no. I think ,

 They dont say we wish youd bring them back?,

 Of course we wish would bring them back but We always hear can you get my son home quicker or my daughter home quicker. Right. Yes.,

 What do you say to that?,

 Well I think thatyou know I saw the earlier segment and I think thats what Joe and Barack are trying to do. Theyre going toyou know they brought our troops out of Iraq like they said that they were going to and now theyre going to start to bring them out of Afghanistan. It was interesting watching Jills reaction when she came to Iraq into a war zone with me on the 4th of July. And it was interesting to watch herwell youit was just kind of fascinating. Yes. I met with women soldier who you know had kids going off to college and hadI met with mothers who had to actuallytheir husbands were deployed and they had to leave their children with another family. And you know theyre incredible men and women and they never complain about their circumstances. And really I just feel such pride in our forces.,

 Your son was there. Your stepson.,

 Well we dont say step Larry.,

 What do you say?,

 We dont. Hes just our son. Son yes.,

 Were back with the Bidens. What a couple they are. And you had to go through the loss of a wife.,

 Yes. But I tell you no man deserves one great love let alone two. I got real lucky.,

 Is this your first marriage?,

 No this is my second.,

 So youve had two loves.,

 Well yes. Maybe maybe.,

 Thats a great line.,

 I love you child. I love you.,

 Back to the militarythat was funny. The outgoing chairman of the House Armed Services Committee Ike Skelton says he worries that theres a kind of chasma chasm between American civilians and the military families and their thoughts. In other words a lot of civilians say we should get out of there. The military families lets stay in there. That seems like a contradiction in terms. You would think the military family would be more interested in them coming home.,

 I also think he said if you dont mind my sayingI know Ike really well. He and I have talked at length about here you have one percent of the population fighting these wars ,

 Right.,

and does the other 99 percent understand what theyre going through? And that was one of the chasms that Ike spoke about. And Jill has worked withI mean anywayyou were asked the question. I apologize. But I think that they are so proud of what theyre doing. I mean thats their job. Thats what theyre committed to do and they have pride in their work and what theyre doing.,

 Do they understand it?,

 I think they do understand it. And how could they not understand it with all the news coverage?,

 You came in an administration headed by a man very opposed to war. Well who isnt opposed to war?,

 Yes.,

 But voted against Iraq.,

 Well look ,

 Has that perception in himand maybe both of youchanged sincein the past two years?,

 Look he was against the war in Iraq because he thought it could have been avoided and it should have been avoided. He at the very beginning was not againsthe thought we had to react in Afghanistan where al Qaeda was where theywhere they came in andand actually killed us. And the thing thats interesting about the confluence of his commitment to make America safe and what Jill does running around the country isyou notice theres this great phrase only one percent of the Americans are fighting the war but 99 percent owe them their support. And itsits really interesting. Both Jill and Barack are from the Vietnamnot the Vietnam era. They did nottheirtheir ,

 But you are.,

 I am. I am. Andand so what Jill and Barack wanted to make sure and Michelle wasand I agree with themthatthat coming home from these wars that they never are treated like the guys in my generation who came home. Instead of being spat upon theyd be embraced. And so thats why I thinkin fact I knowwhy Jill and Michelle spent so much time going around the country reminding people.,

 You meet with people whove lost people?,

 Oh yes. All the time.,

 How do you deal with that?,

 Well itit is really hard and Joe and I have spent a lot of timea lot of time with wounded warriors. Actually next Monday were having a dinner for wounded warriors at the residence. We did it lastWe have three Thanksgivings a year. Yeah. We did it last Thanksgiving. Weve been to many many hospitals burn centers. Its tough. Its really tough.,

 Theres no formula is there?,

 No. Theres no formula. Andbut the one thing thatone of the reasons I wanted Joe to join this team to join this administration is that Barack wanted to getwanted to get out of Iraq. And I so badly wanted to get out of Iraq especially since I had a son going to Iraq. Well I wanted to get out of Iraq but its interesting I did not initially want to be vice president. And when asked initially I saidhe said he needed an answer right away and II said well if you need an answer now Barack the answers no. And he said well go home and talk to your family about it and get back to me. And it really surprised me when I went home Jill said youve got to do this. And this is not a woman whos pushing me to run for President before or wanted me to be vice president. But it was her firm conviction about Iraq.,

 Were back with the Bidens. Did Iraq change your son?,

 I dont think so. Do you Joe? I dont think it changed him. I think ithe came away with an overwhelming impression about the men and women he served with. Notnonono joke. I mean he said dad youd be amazed at these guys and these women. Youd just be amazed. And II was not amazed. I was there so many times. But Jill came with me and an interesting thing. On the way back I said you know Jill I feel guilty. I was here four times during the year Bo was here in Iraq. And I always felt guilty I got to see him. And I said I wish you had. And tell him your reaction to that. Yeah. I said if I had beenif I had gone when Bo was there I couldnt have left him there. You know I dont think any mother who goes to a war zone could ever leave a child in a war zone.,

 Couple of other things. You said that Americas community colleges are its best kept secret.,

 Yes.,

 In what way?,

 Well I think community collegecolleges offer so much and especially inin this economy. You know theyrepeople come to them for job training. Theyre a fraction of the cost of four-year colleges. And ,

 You never hear about them much.,

 Well I hope thats changed.,

 Youre changing it.,

 I hope thats changed because this administration so supports community colleges and education. And thats one of the joys of working in this administration. And soShe even spoke in the international forum in the U.N. about you know have everybody trying to set up Harvards of the world in these developing countries. And the point is what youve got to do is you set up these community colleges quickly. You get the biggest bang for the buck theyre more affordable people get something substantial for careers out of them and itsits a good buy.,

 OK. Thanksgivings right around the corner. What do you make in a lot of discussion now in America youeverybodys got an opinion the pat-down policy? Cause theres going to millions at airports.,

 Well look Larry maybe because I spend so much time every morning dealing with the threat assessment thats out there and the fact that its realI understand peoples frustration but Iunless theres a new technology that comes along pretty quickly I think itsI think its a necessary policy. I think it will have the effect of saving lives intercepting explosives oror before ,

 But in a democracy its an invasion. I mean it is an invasion.,

 WellIt is but if you think about it I mean really were fightingI mean terrorism isits a threat. And I think Americans shouldI mean they should realize it andand put up with it I think.,

 Anyone in the administration against doing it?,

 No. Were all in the administration saying continue to look to see what the best technology and the least intrusive that gives us the greatest security.,

 How you guys spending Thanksgiving?,

 We go to Nantucket and weve done it for over 30 years to get away. Its been 35 years. Back after we first gotfive years after the accident I met Jill. I had an administrative assistant wonderful guy who was 20 years older. And her mom and dad wanted me and the boys to come to dinner my mom and dad and my deceased wifes mom and dad. And he said the way to do that ishe said pick a spot where just you and the family go every year so no ones offended. And heI said where. And he saidI said Nantucket. Ive never been to Nantucket in the winter. I mean whatand weve been doing it for 35 years. Now 20 of us go. Our children.,

 Were out of time. Thanks Jill. Your first appearance.,

 Oh thanks. And happy birthday.,

 Thank you. Yes tomorrow. Thank you. Hey thanks for the kind words.,

 A great run old buddy.,

 Good evening. Stevie Wonder needs no introduction. So why am I introducing him? Except for this. He is a genius one of the most influential artists and people of our time. We welcome him back to Larry King Live. He is the recipient of 25 Grammys and a Lifetime Grammy. Hes a political and social activist. Last time he was on this show by the way he was on the eve of the inauguration of Barack Obama. We start that way Stevie. How do you think hes doing?,

 I think President Obama is doing very well. I think then obviously we were with a mess unfortunately the previousat the end of the previous eight years. And I think you know its almost like when you gain a lot of weight it takes more than a minute to get it off. So weve got some things that we got into unfortunately that happened. Its going to take it time to get it back to where it needs to be and to move forward. But I think that he is moving the world forward. I think that you know reports are coming out that basically that the economy is getting better that jobs that are happening and I just think that we have top stay on point as a united people of America.,

 Stevie Wonder youve always been an activist by the way? Are you always active in political things?,

 I was sort of like the year we were talking aboutlike when I was a little kid obviously activist trying to make sure my mother got me what I wanted to get for Christmas. So ,

 Active in that.,

 But no I think Ive always had myyou know my feelings about different things and obviously you know the whole thing about whats right and whats wrong. I think that maybe more a socialist you know just feeling that there is no reason why we cant you know work it out as a united people of the United States of America but not just that of the world.,

 All right. Lets discuss this extraordinary career. Where did you grow up?,

 Detroit.,

 A child of Detroit born blind?,

 Yes. Well actually I was not born blind but shortly after that because of being premature I had then being in the incubator (INAUDIBLE)it is a condition ,

 Do you see some light?,

 I may have. I think the retrolental fibroplasia thats what its called. And it happens fromor it happened anyway from the temperature of thehaving to much oxygen and many kids that were born in the 50s before the doctor discovered that you know there was another way to do it I became blind.,

 Do you have brothers and sisters?,

 I havenow five or four brother and one sister. I lost a brother a few years ago.,

 They were all sighted?,

 Yes.,

 How did your parentswhat did your father do?,

 My father really was not the dominant person who raised the family it was my mother who raised the family. And my mother worked at a fish company working withfor a while and then fortunately we were blessed with me being discovered at the age of 9 then signing to Motown by the age of 10 and then at 11 had the first record out.,

 And that helped the whole family?,

 We did make some money.,

 You were a protegee. When did youdid you play piano like when you were like 5?,

 Yes I played piano. I mean Iyou know obviously sound was very important to me. So when I was able toyou know to touch that thing whats called a piano you know I was curious about it and I think the firstthat was probably the first thing that I played.,

 Three Blind Mice.,

 Exactly.,

 Appropriately enough. Was itit had to be tough. Ive interviewed George Schering. Im sure you knew George Schering.,

 He was great. Great man.,

 Yes. He said that when youve never seen he didnt regard it as a handicap. Because thats the only thing he knew.,

 Yes. I mean its definitely more difficult for someone who has seen and then lost their sight because obviously youre used to seeing and you used to being able to look at something then rather than go right to it even though thats you know true its not impossible to survive and to live. So ,

 Obviously youve proven it. Were going to trace some extraordinary musical career. Weve just started with Stevie Wonder. Well talk more about his inner visions too. Dont go away.,

 Now let me say this to you. I want to interview you too.,

 OK. In a while.,

 Im a fan of yours. I know youre going to be ,

 Were back with Stevie Wonder. Do you remember the first thing you ever wrote?  Theres a song I wrote called Elephant Della.,

 Elephant Della thats the name I keep hearing in my heart. Elephant Dellaits like some ,

 That could be a hit.,

 I dont think so. It wasnt then and its not now.,

 What was the first hit?,

 The first hit we had was a song called Fingertips. And originally ,

 Third album right?,

 That was in theyes third album. The jazz soul of my heart. The first time it was recorded it was a live (INAUDIBLE) which was a project that Motown did with me playing the harmonica and the piano and drums and stuff. So its like a kind of jazzed project. And than we did Tribute to Uncle Ray which is a tribute to Ray Charles that we did. And then we were on the Motown Menu and in Chicago the Fingertips was done again. We came up with a live version of it. Clarence Paul who was my music director at the time came up with an idea foryou know everybody say yes and all that stuff. And that was put on the album that was called Little Stevie Wonder Live at the Apollo.,

 Youre alwaysyou aint so little anymore. You were once Little Stevie Wonder right?,

 Never little. Big in spirit. Small in size. Growth to kind of match my spirit.,

 Did the harmonica come naturally to you too?,

 It was aharmonica was something that you know obviously growing up in Detroit youd hear the different harmonica players come and playing the blues and walking down on the streets. When I was off for the Christmas holiday season an uncle gave me a harmonicachromatic harmonica. And obviously I didnt know what to do with the button. I said what is this for? Andso likebut then I figured that you know for me playing the harmonica after a while was like the saxophone to me. And so it was like ,

 You take to music youre called a genius. Did that bother you being called a genius so young?  The amazing thing about being called a genius is I never paid any attention to it. I mean I appreciated it but II think since the very early age I felt like this here is a gift from God and Im only being used as a vehicle through which I can do these things. So you know when you think about it at 13 years old you know youre a big star and all of that kind of stuff. And youre talking about these interviews and things theyre going to do. OK fine but I want to go and watch Huckleberry Hound. I was definitely a kid. And you never stop being a kid. When you write a song where does it come from? I mean you dont see colors. You dont see people. You dont know what a television set looks like. You feel a piano but youve never seen a piano. Where does the music come from?,

 I honestly think that if Iyou know were to see a piano or to see someone or all the other things you mentioned Iif ever I was to see it I think Id be pretty close to where I imagine it to be. I think Ive got a pretty good imagination. And I think that you know we really feel before we see. We really hear before we see. Because the information you know goes into our minds and we have towe have to reallyI mean if were honest with ourselves if were being ourselves we have to say OK this is how I view this. But when you have preconceptions if your vision gives you preconceptions then youve got a problem with yourself.,

 Do you read Braille?,

 What is that?,

 You dont read Braille?,

 Im kidding you. Of course I read Braille yes.,

 Going to play a little under me. Were going to a break. Play anything under me. Anything you wrote. My guest is Stevie Wonder. More music with Stevie as our guest. Were honoring him tonight for the full hour. Dont go away. Were back with Stevie Wonder. What a career. You toured with the Rolling Stones back in 1972.,

 Right.,

 I was going to ask what was that like backstage. What was that like?,

 It was interesting. And we had a lot of fun. A lot of what I wrote for Talking Book the album that was very successful. Around that time I didI wrote on that tour. Superstition I wrote on a day off of the tour for the Stones. I mean we had a good time. We really did.,

 Did you like their music?,

 We went to the Playboywas it the ,

 Playboy Club.,

 To the mansion. We went to the Playboy mansion in Chicago. And at that time stupid me I took my girlfriend so whatyou know? How much trouble could I really get into? But it was great. I remember once we were performingwe performed I thinkwas itMadison Square. And theres a big crowd obviously coming to the show. And the guy said listen nobody can get in but Mick Jagger. If youre not one of the Stones you cant get through here. And so I said but this is Stevie Wonder. This is Stevie Wonder. I dont care about Stevie Who but we want Mick Jagger. If youre with the star youll get through. I said well I am Mick Jagger. Oh you are? Why you say that? They let me through.,

 Did you like their music?,

 Yes I did.,

 You did. OK. When you write a song lets thinkwhere does it likeMy Cheri ,

 When I do.,

 My Cheri Amour. What a beautiful song. Where did that come from?,

 That song reallyit was a song was originally called,

 My Marsha?,

 Yes. My MarshaI wish that you were mine.,

 So why did you change it?,

 Marsha and I broke up. And so the lyricistthe lyricist Silvia Moy wrote My Cheri Amour. Sorry Marsha. But ,

 Oh. Marsha youre sorry today arent you? When you thinkwhen you ,

 Shes probably saying well its about (INAUDIBLE) anyway so whatever.,

 When you think a song out someone has to write down all the notes right?,

 Well you know in todays technology you can play on a keyboard like this or any of the other keyboard and ,

 Someone can write from it?,

 Or a piano. And through MIDI which is the technology that takes based on numbers digital information and take that information and convert that into the writing of each note that you play. The amount of beats or bars that you play the song in. So thats how it happens today. Now ,

 The machine can write the note?,

 Yes there is a machine that can write or through the computer and software it can be written out.,

 Are you always thinking of music? Are you always sort of writing in your head?,

 I cant say that Im always writing in my head but I do spend a lot of time in my head writing or coming up with ideas. And what I do usually is write the music and melody and then you know maybe the basic idea. But when I feel that I dont have a song or just say God please give me another song. And I just am quiet and it happens. Its just amazing.,

 Like?,

 Like,

 Play something.,

 Larry were going to miss you so dont ever go too long. If youre a woman I may have kissed you but that will never happen happen ever. Larry I remember listening to you when you interviewed James Brown on the radio. I was younger then and you were too a few years ago.,

 Do you have a favorite song?,

 Favorite song. You know I always when people ask me like what is my most favorite song I quote Duke Ellington when they would ask him whats his favorite composition? And I say I havent written it yet. Because you know there are different songs for different occasions. Theres My Cheri Amour for a certain day theres As for a certain day. You know I Just Called to Say I Love You for a certain day happyI mean just different songs. A vision for a certain day. So I think that the blessing is that I have been able to write songs that have created so many different emotions at different times that I can connect to.,

 Do you remember where it beginslike I Just Called to Say I Love You where did the inspiration came from?,

 I think the idea of the story came from really the spirit of you know how love is something thats for all seasons whether thered be a holiday or not a holiday or just being able to express that place any time love is always something that can be expressed. And then for years I just had theI just called to say I love you I just called to say how much I care.,

 Do the lyrics come to you right away too?,

 Well the lyric for that came from me having some words already and then putting them together in a way that worked good for the film and equally as important for the song.,

 Did you know that it was going to be a hit?,

 I knew it was going to be a hit. I knew that,

 I thought you would know that.,

 I knew that.,

 Of course how could that not be a hit?,

 I just felt good about it all the time. I remember playing it for different times different birthdays and stuff. But I see only had some words I would just make up at the time.,

 You had other words for that too?,

 I mean basically,

 Was there a Marsha for that?,

 No Marsha. No Marsha.,

 Have you written a song you thought would be a smash and wasnt?,

 Oh we all have that. Every single writer has a song that they think is going to be you know incredible and then,

 What was one that disappointed you?,

 I think a song I did All About the Love Again I wrote that a while back and then recently we put it on the album for President Barack Obama for the campaign. And I remember when II wrote the song the idea of it wasthe melody was so catchy.Da da doo da Oh yeah it sounds so good to me,

 How could that miss?,

 I know. Whats up? Sounds good to me.,

 Sounds good to me Stevie Wonder signed sealed delivered hes yours next.,

 I never dreamed in the summer but now my my love has gone away. Michael why didnt you stay? I loved Michael a lot. I just felt that the way that certain people that you know theywell heres the deal. I felt that if youre going befriend someone and God forbid they pass away then why do you come after they died to talk about their business? I was not feeling that at all.,

 Were back with Stevie Wonder. I guess the song that is more singers sing nightclub performances my wife sings it. She sings a lot of club songs is For Once In My Life.,

 Hey so you want me to write your wife a song?,

 Yeah Id love you to.,

 Are you serious?,

 Yeah.,

 OK Ill do that. Seriously I will do it. And the reason I will do it because as much of some of the things that I did see when you were doing the thing about Michael Jackson kind of pissed me off a little bit-but I thought the spirit in which you kept it with integrity was great.,

 Tell me about For Once In My Life. Where did that come from? You can take it The way that went was I was in Motown in Detroit. And I was with my producer Hank Cosby at the time whoI said Ive got this great idea. Obviously I heard Tony Bennett do the song when I was like maybe 12 years old 13 whatever it was 14. And I loved it you know what he did with the song. But by about 17 18 I said wow thats such a great song. Let me try to do it another way. I said Hank Ive got a great idea to do this song. He said what song? I said For Once In My Life So I went to the studio and so I go like- What are you doing whats up? I said Listen just listen. They said what song? I said For Once In My Life.,

 For once in my life I have someone who needs me someone I needed so long. For once Im unafraid I can go where life leads me somehow I know Ill be strong. For once I can touch what my heart used to dream of long before I knew oh someone warm like you would make - By the time I get to that I hear this knock on the door. And so Ron says what are you doing to my song? And I said Im telling you Ron this is going to be a hit. He said No no no. I said Im telling you this is a good way to do it. He said OK. If Im wrong you know Ill buy you dinner. If Im right you buy me car-no. But any way I said Im telling you I feel it.,

 You put your own stamp on it though.,

 I just felt that that was the way to do it. It was a song that was reallyI mean in both ways obviously its a great song. I think part of a great song is that youre able to do various interpretations of that song.,

 Yeah.,

 And so that song done like that to me it felt like what I could relate to at 17 18 years old.,

 Play us to the break. Weve got to go to break here. Be my tune smith.,

 You going to sing with me? Come on lets go.,

 Sure lets go.,

 For once in my life I have someone that needs me someone that Ive needed for so long; for once I unafraid I can go where life leads me and somehow I know Ill be strong. My heart is a dreamer long before I knew -,

 Were back with Stevie Wonder. How did Ebony and Ivory come about?,

INTERVIEWEE: Side by side on my piano keyboard oh Lord why dont we? It was a promotion person that worked for Motown for some years that reached out to someone that was working with me at the time saying that Paul McCartney had a song that he felt would be great for he and I to do together. The other person was Herb Beeker (ph) who worked in Motown right when I first got with Motown. And so you know we worked it out to connect and get together. We met in Manzerott (ph) and we recorded the song. I felt the sentiment would be something that was appropriate and I just felt that at the end of the day it really is about you know being able to you know understand that we may have differences of opinions but at the end of the day we have to come together and live and work together. Just as on my piano why cant we? So it was a great song.,

 And at a Larry King Cardiac Gala we sang that song together.,

 I remember that.,

 But I didnt do ivory. What did I sing?,

 You may have been ebony.,

 No I was ebony and you were ivory.,

 Yeah.,

 Lets see if we remember a little bit of it. I dont remember the first line.,

 Ebony. Ebony and ivory lived together in perfect harmony side by side on my piano keyboard oh Lord why cant we? Side by side on my piano keyboard oh Lord why cant we? Ebony and ivory,

 How we going to top that?,

 You stopped singing in the middle of it.,

 I know I gave up.,

 So when the record comes out you dont get as much as me.,

 OK. How many instruments do you play?,

 Keyboards drums harmonica percussion instruments.,

 Anybody you want to work with that you havent?,

 I mean Im a big fan of music. Im a music lover. So there probably isnt no one that I wouldnt want to work it. I think it would come down to the chemistry. And if the chemistry was right and we had both the same feeling about working together and if they could sing or play and they didnt mind being challenged Im good.,

 Will you play Sir Duke to break? I need some tea. Hold on. How can we do this? One handed.,

 Music is a world within itself the language that we all understand with an equal opportunity for all to sing and clap their hands just because the record has a groove dont make it in the group but you can tell right away when the people start to move. They can feel it all over they can feel it all over people. They can feel it all over they can feel it all over people.,

 All right. The crew was talking before we began this interview and they all said they love a song which is not familiar to me Ive got some musical knowledge but I dont know everything. And the song is called Part-Time Lover. Whats your take on that? How did that come about?,

 How did I write the song or what?,

 Yeah. Not Marsha again.,

 This would have involved a fewa couple different people. But this song I wrote when I was in England and I dont know it was just an idea. The whole thing the beat then was likeand so it was like - Call up once hang up the phone to let me knowlet me start again. Call up ring once hang up the phone to let me know you made it home. Got nothing to be wrong with part-time lover. If shes with me Ill blink the lights to let you know tonights the night for me and you my part-time lover. Chasing love underneath the sun we are strangers by day lovers by night knowing its so wrong but feeling so right. You know we can go on and on.,

 Do you still do a lot of concerts?,

 Yes. We just recently did the tour throughout Europe. Weve had different concepts. The next two Im going to do is going to be called Threw The Eyes of Wonder. And the concept of that tour is going to be really taking the ideas that I see you know the visuals how Ihow Ive done the various songs and how I visualize various things could be with something that would be a visual. Whether it be a video whether it be staging them a certain kind of way. Because I think that you know obviously with every song that Ive written I have sort of a vivid imagination or pictures as to how I view and how I see as well as the world itself.,

 Through The Eyes Of Wonder what a great idea. Do you ever gethow old are you now Stevie?,

 60.,

 You ever think of hanging it up?,

 Hanging what up?,

 Hanging up the career just retiring?,

 Obviously there will be some point when Ill decide OK Ive got a daughter that sings a son that sings. Ive got family that you know are talented little children are very talented. And so I think you know at some point you know life will give itself to them. And by then whenever that might be Ill just not do it. Maybe just write songs or whatever. ButI love performing.,

 Our remaining moments with the great Stevie Wonder. Iboy. Itsits so unbelievable to have hadto be able to sit with people like you and to experience you firsthand for a little kid from Brooklyn.,

 If I could ask you a question how have you enjoyed youve met so many different personalities ,

 Ive enjoyed every minute of it.,

 Really?,

 50 years went by like yesterday. I remember the first day I started. But this is about you. So Im going to the great Artie Shore he stopped playing at age 53. And I asked him why and he said he had nothing more to say. Do you ever feel that way?,

 For as long as theres life for as long as we have things happening in the world for as long as people havent been able to work it out for as long as people are not trying to work it out for as long as theres crime and destruction and hate bigotry for as long as there is a spirit that does not have love in it I will always have something to say.,

 Do you ever sing what Ray Charles used to sing you ever sing America?,

 I havent sang the song. I like the song.,

 You ought to sing America The Beautiful.,

 OK. I think its a very very pretty song. Certain songs you hear people sing you say you know what? Im not going to think about touching that because in he case of Ray he did such an incredible job of it. The national anthem that Whitney Houston did incredible. And so there are various pieces that obviously in time I will do. But I think that I have an appreciation for the talents of those people that have done them incredibly. Theres a song that I wrote called Until You Come Back To Me and my version was very sort of pop oriented a little bit. And Aretha did it Aretha Franklin did it and it was like forget about it.,

 Play a little of it while were closing out. Stevie Wonders been our guest. AC 360 is going to follow and the latest news on CNN. Play us out Stevie.,

 I sit and wait in vain. I love to rap on your door tap on your window pane I want to tell you baby the changes Ive been going through missing you till you come back to me thats what Im going to do.,

 Good night everybody.,

 Till you come back to me thats what Im going to do,

 OK. Now youre in Orlando for a reason. Shes coming to us from the Orange County Convention Center. Youve earned multiple Grammys a Country Music Awards. Too numerous to mention. National Medal of the Arts Kennedy Center honoree nominated for Oscars Golden Globes and an Emmy and now Dollywood won last night the prestigious Applause Award. Tell me about that.,

 Yay.,

 What is that?,

 Well actually its aIll show it to you. Its heavy but I wanted you to see it. Can you see that?,

 Its hands applauding. Nice.,

 There.,

 Nice. Nice.,

 Yes it is. And they actually give these out every other year. And this is the first time weve received it. Theyyou only get it one time. But its really a very prestigious thing. Its really kind of like winning an Oscar in show business. But it really says that you are the number one park in the world. Not just the United States but all over the world. And its voted on by a committee of your peers. And so we were very fortunate that we got it this year. We have a wonderful park in Dollywood wonderful people there that keep it running. And you getthey vote on it for cleanliness beauty the shows and everything that just kind of says this is a wonderful place for families and people to go. So were very proud and very honored down here.,

 How long has Dollywood been open? ,

 Well like you this is my 25th anniversary. Wereactually weve had a lot of wonderful things going on all year and weve celebrated. We had a special. And then to be able to win this to kind of top off our 25th year it was a wonderful thing. So we opened in 86.,

 Dolly how did it come about? You know weve done a lot of talks in the past and Dollywood is a fabulous place. But not many country music artists have their own amusement park. How did that come about?,

 Well actually its a theme park. But it does have amusement areas in it. And I was always fascinated with the county fair growing up back in the mountains of east Tennessee. As you know Im from a big family. We didnt get out too much and haveyou know get to have a lot of fun. I mean as far as things like that. So when the county fair would come to town we would get to go. The school would take us so I was always impressed with that. And after I got into show business I always thought well itd be wonderful if I could do something great for my home county provide jobs for the people in the area because it was a very rural and poor area. And really to have a place for people to go to have fun. So it started out in a very sincere way. And when we opened it was just a hit right out of the chute although a lot of my business people thought I was making a mistake. They dont think that now. But it was just a wonderful thing to do and its just been a great thing for us.,

 And its in Penny Forge Tennessee. Now if its in an outlying area remote area where you grew up do people have a hard time finding it?,

 Oh no. Its right on the main highway. Pigeon Forge is an areaits from Knoxville and you go right up to Gatlinburg and the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. So its right on the main road into the national park where we have at least what 10 million people a year I suppose coming in and out of the Smoky Mountains National Park. So its situated in a great area. Its kind of off the beaten path just a little but its got all the signs saying Dollywood that way. But its reallythat area has really grown a lot in the last several years. But the Smoky Mountains and Gatlinburg have always been wonderful. Sevier County is a great area. So its just a good place to have a business.,

 Were you alwaysmost singers are interested only in singing. Were you always interested in the business side of things?,

 Yes. I think Ive got my business notions and my sense for that sort of thing from my dad. My dad never had a chance to go to school. He couldnt read and write. But he was so smart. He was just one of those people that could just make the most of anything and everything that he had to work with. And it was you know obvious he had to with raising 12 kids just a farmer. Later on he worked on construction. But my dad was really really smart. And I think I got a lot of that from him. And my mothers people are very creative so thankfully I had the creative stuff to make a way for myyou know for my business sense. But I enjoy the business end of things and I look at it like show business. I mean I love being in show business. But I like to look and work the business end of it as well. So when I see an opportunity I jump all over it.,

 But it does add responsibility in that people work for you people are dependent on you whereas most people who are singers they travel they sing. They dont have hundreds of people responsible to make a living.,

 Well thats true. We actually are the number one employer in all of east Tennessee. We hire about 3000 people with our Dixie Stampede Dinner theaters with our Splash Country and Dollywood all the Dollywood companies there. And weve actually paid out $1 billion in salaries since we started Dollywood. But I do enjoy being part of all that. I haveI have surrounded myself with very smart people. I certainly wouldnt claim to be able to do all that myself. But at least Im smart enough to know Ive got to get good smart people to help with all of those things. And I have wonderful partners and wonderful people that help with all of that and make me look good.,

 Do you think you were driven by the fact that you were raised so poor?,

 I think so. I think that I know the value of a dollar. I know that I always wanted things. I was always proud of my people proud of my home but I always wanted more. I think most people do. And not just for myself but for my family as well. I wanted to do well to make them proud as well as being able to help out. And so I think that a lot of that did come from not having anything growing up. But its wonderful to still be able to go home be a part of all that and have all the people in the county love me and appreciate me. And you know it makes me feel like Ive stayed at home and that I have people that are proud of me. Not just my own family but everybody in the whole area. I just feel like Im still part of them and theyre part of me. ,

 Were back with Dolly Parton. Do you remember your first paycheck?,

 Yes I do. I still have my first paycheck. It was just I think a dollar or two that I got when I started as a songwriter with BMI and I had some songs there that I had through the company and in the mail I got this big old check for like a dollar and a half or something. Somebody had recorded one of my songs. So somewhere in my things I haveI have my first check.,

 Are you always writing songs?,

 Yes. I write a lot of songs. Ive got thousands of songs. I really havent counted them. People always ask me that. Years and years ago someone asked me. I said probably two or 3000 but Im sure theres many hundreds more now because I love to write. Its my favorite thing that I do. And I justits my way of expressing myself. Its a way to express the feelings of people I love that are not able to put it down on paper or rhyme it in words. So its a great outlet and its fun. Its a hobby a joy and a job.,

 What was your first hit?,

 My first hit. I guess the first big hitI did not write. My first radio record was a song Curly Putman wrote. It was my first top 10 record. It was called Dumb Blondes which Ive become kind of famous for. But actually I started writing songs during that period of time myself. But the first big songs that I started having would be Jolene and the original version of I Will Always Love You Coat of Many Colors. All of those wereI think Code of Many Colors was in the late 60s. That was one of the very first hits that I had.,

 All right.,

 Tennessee Mountain Home and then the 70s brought Jolene and I Will Always Love you and some other songs you recognize.,

 I Will Always Love You has been covered a lot hasnt it?,

 Yes it has. Thats been the biggest moneymaking song that Ive ever had. Of course Whitney Houston made it such a popular record from The Bodyguard movie and Kevin Costner had chosen that song to use in the movie. And so it became world famous and its known as the number one love song in all the world which makes me feel very proud to be part of that. But yes that one has been around a while.,

 Last time you were here Barack Obama had just been sworn in as president. You said that you were excited thought hed do great.,

 Yes.,

 How is he doing?,

 Well hes certainly not as popular now as he was then but Im still praying for him. Im still hoping that he does well. Its justthese are hard times. I dont think it would matter who is in the White House. I think were going to always crucify them andbecause if we cant make it happen overnight then wereyou know we just dont know what to do. So Im just hoping that whoever is in the White House at any time you know just tries to help you know the country just do better. So Im for anybody thats trying to help us out. And I think hes trying.,

 Do you ever lookyou look at your upbringing you look at all thats happened to you. Do you ever look in the mirror and kind of pinch yourself?,

 Well I do feel very fortunate. When I look in the mirror thats not what Im thinking. I pinch myself here and pinch myself there. Say what can I pull up? Maybe that needs to go. But anyway I do pinch myself sometimes thinking that you know this is really amazing. I thank God every day for it. Im very humbled by it because I know so many people that have had the same dreams that Ive had that never get to see them come true. So I know a certain amount of it is luck. A lot of it is hard work. Ive been very fortunate. I do work hard and Ive always said I have more guts than talent but I try to keep those two things balanced and I try when I have a dream to kind of get it out there and push ityou know push it on through.,

 I understand youre doing the movie Joyful Noise with Queen Latifah. Tell me about it.,

 Yes Im very excited about that. Its a Warner Brothers picture and we have been in L.A. together for the last couple of weeks. Weve been working on some pre-records for the music. We really liked each other a lot. Our personalities are very compatible which I thought they would be. I knew I would love working with her. And I had never met her though until then. Wed talked on the phone after we started talking about doing the movie. But our voices blended really well. Our personalities seemed to really you know gel. So I think were going to have a lot of fun doing it and it looks like its going to be a wonderful show. It was written and will be directed by a guy named Todd Graf. And hes done a wonderful script. Its aboutits a music-driven movie. Its not a musical but its got a lot of music gospel uplifting songs. And so its about a choir that competes around the country with different choirs. So its got a lot of fun a lot of music a lot of joy and I think its going to make people feel real good once they leave the theater provided they come which we hope they do.,

 Were back with Dolly Parton. Were looking forward to seeing Joyful Noise where she costars with Queen Latifah. Why so long between movies? You know you had such a hit. Well talk about 9 to 5 in a while. Why didnt you get more films?,

 Well I dont really get a lot of good scripts. And I get a lot of junk come across my desk and you know into our offices. But I really am looking for something good. And when this one came along it just seemed to be so perfect because I think the writer wrote it for her and for me specifically and thats why you know we were really ready to go pretty soon after we both read the script and said yes we love it. Yes we love each other. Yes wed love to do it. So it was just one of those things. I usually wait for things to come. I dont try to beat my brains out over it. I want to do things thats close enough to my personality to where I can carry it off. And I get a lot of stuff that I just dont think Im a good enough actress to do it or its just junk and I dont want to do it. So Ive been lucky with the movies that I have done and this one hopefully will be one of most fun ones.,

 Do you duet with Queen Latifah a lot?,

 Well actually we do sing in the choir of and on together. But yes we have one duet song that I wrote. And it actually is the front of the movie. So we do get to kind of banter back and forth and kind of sing against each other and kind of get our frustrations and our joys and our fun out you know toward each other. So our voices blend really well and Im very excited about that.,

 Your most famous film which will live forever in film lore is 9 to 5. Did you think that would be the hit it became?,

 No. Well you never know whats going to be a hit.,

 Of course.,

 Its just like when you write songs. You hope theyre all going to be a hit and think theyre going to be great but I did not know what that one would be. That was as you know the very first movie I had ever done. I had never even seen a movie made at that time or been around that. So that was kind of like a first love. It will always be the most special Im sure as far as that goes. But it was a wonderful thing and Ive worked that 9 to 5 job for 30 years now. That came out 30 years ago and of course I got to write music for a Broadway musical of it and now were on the road. The road tour started in September in Nashville. So now its going to be all around the country. So its just still kicking along there.,

 I remember right before the musical opened itit played five months. You got mixed reviews. Have you changed a little for the touring company?,

 Well actually wethe musics all the same. My songs stayed the same. Luckily the music got good reviews and I guess itlike you say it got mixed reviews in different areas. But weits not as high tech as it was on Broadway. The road show of course you cant travel with all that equipment. And I dont know if you actually saw the Broadway show or not. I didnt. There was a lot of high tech stuff. But weve kind of narrowed it down to where its really more sensible and it fits the road more and its more like office stuff. So its different. We still have a wonderful cast great singers. So Im very proud of it and I enjoyed you know being on Broadway seeing that come you know to fruition. And Im just glad toyou know to just have it still going. I dont know how long it will go. Its kind of like the Energizer bunny. It just keeps on going.,

 Did itdoes it sting you when you get a poor review?,

 Well it always hurts you when you dont get theyou know the good reviews but you try to learn from it. I learned years ago if you have fall under that and just blame the critics or the person criticizing you youre never going to learn and grow from that. So Ive learned through the years to look and see what they say and to see if there is truth in it. And usually there is some truth. Sometimes they overdo it. They dont have to be so honest. But anyway I just try to learn from that and apply you know what Ive learned from it to whatever the next project may be. Of course we want everything to be a hit but thats just not how it goes is it?,

 All right. Queen Latifah she came to fame in the hip-hop world. Do you relate to that kind of music?,

 Well I have to be honest with you. I dont really have a lot of time to relate to any kind of music even my own because Im so busy writing stuff and working on my own things and of course country music and gospel music is my favorite. But I appreciate all kinds of music. And every age has its own style of music. Every generation. And you know I think itsome of it is fun. I just dont know that much about it. But I have a feeling I may get hip-hopped a lot now that Im working with her. She mayI may learn to love it. Who knows?,

 Joyful Noise thats about a gospel choir as you said.,

 Yes.,

 You were inducted into the Country Gospel Hall of Fame earlier this year elected into the Gospel Music Associations Gospel Music Hall of Fame in 2009. And you said your music has been almost like a ministry. Can you explain that?,

 Well Im saying my work itself is likealmost like my ministry. You know its likeI feel like that youre out there trying to help people feel better about themselves trying to give them some hope. And even when things are the hardest I try to write songs to lift people up. Thats one reason I think that this Joyful Noise is going to be wonderful. Queen Latifah and Ior Dana is her real name. Weve talked a lot about how this is a great opportunity to make people feel better about themselves. And she grew up with a religious background. I think her people werea lot of them very church people and worked in the choirs and some deaconesssomebody in her family she was joking about. So she grew up in the church with gospel music also. So I grew up that way and Ive always recorded you know songsyou know that are of a more spiritual nature. So I reallyor at least some uplifting qualities or try to. So hopefully this is going to be a wonderful thing. And yes Im honored to be part of the hall of fame. We have the Southern Gospel Hall of Fame housed at Dollywood and were very proud of that.,

 Were back with Dolly Parton winner of this years coveted Applause Award. By the way when will we see Joyful Noise?,

 Well were hoping that it will come out either byat the very end of next year 2011 or early in the 2012. So wereyou know theyre hopeful that they might get it done in 2011 but were not sure about that and I probably shouldnt be taking liberties to talk about when its going to be released but were hoping it might come out next year. If not it will be soon after that.,

 All right. Arentyour grandfather as I understand was a Pentecostal preacher. Did he have any feelingspoor feelings about you going into show business?,

 Well early on my grandpa as you know the Pentecostal Churchyou may or may not know theyre pretty strict on how you dress,

 I know.,

and how you wear your hair and wearing makeup. And so I think early on I was pretty open-minded myself about myself. And I was always you know having all the makeup. And I think my grandpa and a lot of my family worried a little bit at the start thinking maybe I was going to hell in a hand basket. But its like everything else. As soon as I started getting famous and people seemed to love me and I seemed to be touching peoplemy grandpa was one of the first to say how proud he was of me especially after a wrote a song about him called Daddy was An Old- Time Preacher Man. So he would always justmy grandpa would just go downtown and justyou know just tap people on the shoulder. Hed say you know that song Daddy was An Old-Time Preacher Man? Well thats about me. So anyhow he kind of came around ,

 Yes thatll change you.,

 You know after he saw that I was OK. Yes. But he was proud of me.,,

 You have said that you are Miley Cyruss fairy godmother and you were recently on her Disney show Hannah Montana. She has been criticized recently for wearing risque outfits and raunchy dancing. You want to comment on that?,

 Well I dont want to say a whole lot about that. Hopefully she didnt get that from me because I certainly never encouraged her to do any of that. But I think Miley is special. I think shes very talented. I think shes just in a crossshes just kind of in a crosswinds trying to overcome the Hannah Montana little girl and trying to become a young woman. And I think shes justyou know I dont know if shes surrounded by people that are helping you know not make the wise decisions but I know that shes going to be fine or I certainly hope so. I never try to give people advice. I never wanted people giving me advice. I wanted information and I wanted to be left alone to do my own thing. So Im hoping that Miley is going to be just fine. I know shes very gifted and I love her dearly and if she ever needs me Ill do everything I can to help her in any way that I can. So I think we should just let her grow up.,

 Do you think your business is tougher on young girls?,

 Yes. I think it is. I think this day and time life is hard for young people certainly young girls. I think wethings just scare me to death anymore. Im just so glad I dont have children now because I think that it would just be really hard to know how to direct them to know what to say because the world is justyou just cant flaunt enough. You cant just do enough. You cant just talk trashy enough or dress trashy enough. It seems to be like if you dont do that youre not in the in crowd. So I think that theres a lot of pressure just on young people in general and I think they put a lot of pressure on themselves as well trying to compete or thinking that theyre supposed to be like the stars on TV. And I worry that a lot of kids are not really finding their own core their own selves. Theyre own identity. Theyre trying to be like somebody else. So I dont worry about that for my nieces and nephews and just for young people in general.,

 Back in 1978 Dolly Parton was Country Music Associations Entertainer of the Year. She was also a pop crossover artist at the time becoming a major major hit. Last year at age 21 Taylor Swift became the youngest ever to be named Entertainer of the Year by the Country Music Association. She also won Female Vocalist Album of the Year Video of the Year. What do you make of her?,

 I say yay Taylor Swift. I think she is a smart beautiful girl. I think shes making all the right moves. Shes got a good head on her shoulders. Shes surrounded with wonderful people. Her songs are great. She keeps herself anchored. She knows who she is and shes living and standing by that. And I just admire her. I think she is just incredible and a great role model for young people right now.,

 You think theres a danger Dolly in too much too soon?,

 In too much consumed you say?,

 No too muchgetting too much attention. Too much awards too soon ,

 Oh getting much too soon.,

 Yes.,

 Well its just sort of like when they talk about American Idol you know they say well you know they show up and then theyre gone before it happens. And there is a danger in all of that. But with Taylor I honestly think that shes got the qualities that could last a long time. I think shes got a good head on her shoulders. And I dont know if theres such a thing as having too much too soon. I mean if its your time its your time. You shouldnt deny somebody you know what they can have. So Im hoping that shes just having a really really hot streak thats just going to last. I hope her 15 minutes of fame lasts for 40 years and it very well might.,

 What keeps country music keeping on? I think its still the most popular idiom form in America.,

 Well I think country music is popularhas been popular and will always be popular because I think a lot of real people singing about a lot of real stuff about real people. And its simple enough for people to understand it. And we kind of roll with the punches. I believe there will always be that traditional country that I grew up with the Kitty Wells and the Hank Williams. I think there will always be those kind of people and the people that love you know the mountain and bluegrass. And I think its great though that folks like Taylor SmithSmithTaylor Swift can come along and actually take it into other areas and do whatever you know they can with it. And Brad Paisley and all those wonderful people Keith Urban. They really have a good country core with all those great country instrumentsbanjos fiddles and mandolins. And so I think its great that its a flexibleits a flexible music.,

 Do you think the lyric are harder to write? Do you think people like Cole Porter and Irving Berlin could have written country?,

 Well I think a lot of the Cole Porter songs and Irving Berlin I think those songstheyre not that different from country music as far as what theyre saying. They are simple stories simple truths about love or feelings and thoughts. But I think its just the difference in instrumentation and then how you perform it or how you sing it. But a good song is a good song. Doesnt matter who wrote it. You can take an Irving Berlin song and add bluegrass. I even did I Get a Kick Out of You years ago ,

 Cole Porter.,

 I bluegrassed it up and a lot ofyes the Cole Porter song. And people got a lot ofyou know got a kick out of me singing I Get a Kick Out of You.,

 I get a kick out of you Dolly. How do youyou write so many songs. How do you get inspired?,

 Well everything inspires me. You inspire me which by the way Im so happy that I got to be on your show. Were both celebrating our 25th anniversaries. But I loveyou know I love being around people. I love hearing what smart people like you have to say. I watch you interview other people. Sometimes people will say a line or say something and I think wow that will be a good idea for a song. So I justyou know I just pick up things from just day-to- day living and its just easy for me to write about it.,

 All right. Do you like hearingdo you like it when other people are singing your songs?,

 Yes I do. A lot ofa lot of singers or a lot of songwriters Ive heard say I hated how they did my song. They have it in their head a certain way. But Im just happy for anybody to do one of my songs however they want to do it because Im curious to see all the different ways that people can do a song. Just like when Whitney did my simple song ,

 Yes.,

of I Will Always Love You and look what she did. It was mighty. David Foster did this spectacular arrangement on that. And I just thought wow is that my little song? And I just think its amazing. So Im thrilled even when theres songs recorded of mine that dont do as well or some say I hated that version of your song. I like them because Im honored and flattered that people want to do them.,

 Dolly Parton on her new CD by the way duets with the great Norah Jones. Youve sung together before at the CMA awards. What make itwhat makes a duet work and why sometimes does it not work when we have two really good artists?,

 Well thats a very good question. Ive been very successful with duet partners like with Porter Wagner when I started with him the man that actually helped me get started big time in country music. And then Kenny Rogers our voices just blend and our personalities mesh. But I have sung songs with other people and its not like that. And Norah Jones I love her. Our voices really did work. So its really hard to say. You just never know. People just kind of haveKenny Rogers and me justwe might as well be married. People just think were supposed to be together all the time. So its just a matter of I think the personalities and the tones and the qualities in a voice with my little thin high voice and Kennys rich quality it seemed to work. It was the same with Porter. And when I sang with Emmylou Harris and Linda Ronstadt thats a beautiful blend. But its justyou just never know until you kind of luck up on it one day with a great duet partner.,

 Did you want to be on the Sinatra duets album? They should have put you on that.,

 Nobody asked me to be on it.,

 That would have been fun.,

 Sowell I dont know. I guess they thought maybe too country or maybe they didnt have a spot for me. But that would have beenI guess it would have depended on who I sang with.,

 Yes. All right. Your last ,

 I did do aIm sorry.,

 Go ahead. Go ahead.,

 I was going to say I did do a duet with Rod Stewart on one of those classic old songs that Baby Its Cold Outside. I did that a few years back. That was a fun thing to do with him.,

 I love that song.,

 Somebody else could have done it better but nobody would have enjoyed it more than I did.,

 Tour last album was in 2008 Backwoods Barbie. Whats next?,

 Well Im glad you asked. I have a brand new CD that Im working on now that will also be on my label Dolly Records. And its going to come out in early summer. I havent got a title just yet but Im writing all the songs for that. Then Im going to be going on tour in late July and early August. Im going to be in the United States. Then were going to be going to Europe and to Australia in fall and winter. So were still kind of working on the scheduling. And any new information anybody wants to know follow along and keep up to date just contact us at Dollypartonmusic.net. And well have all the information on all the stuff were doing. So Im looking forward to a new CD and a new tour.,

 Were back with the great Dolly Parton. What do you think it is your tie-in with the gay community?,

 Well I have a lot of gay fans female and male. And I think Ive been at this so long a lot of people feel like theyve grown up with me. As you know Ive always been outspoken Ive always been pretty outrageous I always believe that a person should be who they are. And you should be comfortable being who you are and people should leave you alone to be who you are in how you are. So I think Ive always been accepted in the gay community because I accept them. And I have so many fans that always love to come to the shows and they know that Im not judging them. I think people are who they are and Im not God Im not a judge were supposed to love each other exactly for who and what we are.,

 Why do you think there is hostility toward gays? Why are gays bullied?,

 Well Im not sure about all of the reasons that people act the way they do about other people. I just think we need to dig down a little deeper and try to be a little kinder to one another and accept one another foryou know for who we are. I mean you cant tell me that people are any way other than what theyre supposed to be. I dont think gay people are trying to just be different just to make other people miserable. I think people are being who they are and I think they arethey should be who they are. And I think we should be a little more tolerant a little more accepting and understanding of not just the gays but other people. Minorities. We just dont have enough love to reallyto live in this world.,

 But ,

 We really need to. And thats one ofone of the songs that I wrote for the Joyful Noise musical. Its called Not Enough Love andor its called Not Enough. And thats the duet that I sang with Queen Latifah and we really enjoyed singing it. Its likeits just saying you know why cant we be more accepting and loving and tolerant?,

 Butdidnt you grow up where you grew up around segregation?,

 Yes. Actually and I didnt knowwe didnt know any blacks or Hispanics or any of those people growing up. I grew up way back in the mountains. The first black person I ever saw was when I went to high school at Severe County High School when I started in 1960. And the first black people we knewthere were about four black students in our school. And there was a girl in our class and her name was Parton. So they used to kid me all the time. They were saying is this your sister? I said well yes she is. And so it was likeso we hadI was the Parton there and right next to me in our yearbook is like the other Parton and shes black and white. I thought well thatd a God smile right there. And then like when I was working with Queen Latifah her name is Dana Owens and my mothers maiden name is Owens too. And so I said there I said look my first black friend was a Parton and now my next black friend or close friend if we get to be that close is an Owens. So I said we are sisters. Were all sisters and brothers anyway. So I thought that was just a cuteyes.,

 Speaking ofspeaking of sisters and brothers you were one of 12 children but you never had children of your own. Ever regret that?,

 No. This day and time I regret it even less. I used to think I wanted children but I dont have children now. But I tell you looking at the way this world is now its like Im almost glad I dont. ItsI worry enough about my brothers and sisters and their children and my little nieces and nephews and just other peoples children. I just you know hope that they allyou know do great. And so I make a perfect aunt. I get a chance to keep them take them toyou know to Dollywood. They love that. Or take themtake them to one of our Dixie Stampede Dinner Theaters which I forgot to mention. Weve got a new pirate theme at one of our Dixie Stampedes in Myrtle Beach this next year and I got to write all the music for that and I cant wait to takeyou know the kids to go see all that. So I make a better aunt than I would have a mother I think.,

 Couple of moments left with Dolly Parton. Your husband Carl Dean stays in the background. Is that by his design?,

 Oh absolutely. My husband loves staying home. He does not want to be in the limelight. Hes proud of me. He wants me to do anything I want to do that makes me happy as long as I just dont hit on him. I did make him go see 9 to 5 when the show came to Nashville. He wouldnt go to Broadway but I did just kind of grab him and say youre going with me. Actually he went to the dress rehearsal. He wouldnt go you know with the whole crowd there. So he doesnt like to be in the limelight but hes a great guy. Weve been married for 42 years now I guess soa long time.,

 And what got you sowhat got you so involvedyou give time and money to the cause of literacy.,

 Thewere so proud of our Imagination Library. Thats where we give books to children. Started in my home county where we give a book to children from the time theyre born once a month until they start kindergarten. It was such a big hit that the Governor Phil Bredesen in Tennesseein Nashville he took over and we just turned the whole thing into bigger and better then we were all over Tennessee now were all over the United States in Canada and in England. So we just love working with the kids and I think God knew I probably shouldnt have kids of my own so everybodys kids could be mine and I could help in all the ways that I can. So that makes me feel real good and it was based on the fact that a lot of my own relatives didnt get a chance to get an education. So that whole thing worked out really well. And so Iits something I take a lot of pride in.,

 Did you have a book affect you in childhood?,

 Did I ever what?,

 A book.,

 Im sorry.,

 You ever have a book had an impact on you?,

 Oh yes. Actually the book that had the most impact on me is the book that we give out the very first book in the Imagination Library. Its that wonderful little book that everybody knows called The Little Engine That Could. And I like to look at myself and think I am a little engine that did. I think we all can if we think we can and if we get out there and do it. So thats a wonderful little book and a wonderful little message.,

 Dolly congratulations on the Applause Award and everything else on the tour new album and the movie. Keep on keeping on Dolly.,

 Well I will and congratulations to you. Were going to miss the tar out of you. So Ill see you somewhere else though.,

 Down the road.,

 Thank you Larry.,

 Thanks Dolly.,

 Yes.,

 Dolly Parton.,

 Thank you.,

 All right Larry thank you very much. And imam thank you very much for talking with us.,

 Thank you Soledad.,

 Youre just back from the Middle East. Youve been gone for about two months. And youve been pretty quiet about the controversy that has been raging about the proposed structure right near Ground Zero. The debate while youve been gone has gotten louder. And its gotten angrier. Why are you talking now?,

 Well I didnt think it was appropriate for me to speak about this while I was overseas on the trip. I felt I wanted to come home and speak to this issue from my home country from my homeland from my home base.,

 Youve had questions while youve been in the Middle East about the controversy thats swirling in Lower Manhattan. What kind of things are people there asking you about whats happening here?,

 Well theyre very concerned about many things. Theyre concerned about the status of Muslims in America. And in the Gulf where I was which is a very important part for our own national security. Bahrain is the home of the 5th fleet. We have a very important naval base there. Qatar is the place of an important air base that we have there. And the concerns of people there are both about what this means not only within the United States but also what this means for them,

 What the debate means you mean?,

 Yes indeed. Because the United States we are the only global superpower today. What happens here has enormous impact over the rest of the world. People all over the Muslim world admire America love America take America as an example in many many respects. And the status of Muslims in America and how American Muslims speak to these issues and how America engages with its Muslim community has global ramifications.,

 And the big debate really is over how Muslims have engaged with the American community. Youre living that right now. So lets walk back to the very beginning. When did you settle upon this location which is just about two blocks north of Ground Zero for your new Islamic cultural center? Why that particular spot?,

 Well first I must remind everybody that I have been imam of a mosque just 10 blocks from that spot 12 blocks from Ground Zero. Ive been serving that community and that neighborhood for the last quarter of a century. When 9/11 happened we couldnt reach our mosque in the Tribeca area. You know and finally we came back. There was flower letters. Were part of this community. Ive served this community. And this is a community that I have worked for so long. And is important for us as Muslims as Muslims who are in Lower Manhattan to want to give back to the city and the country thats given us so much.,

 So why that particular spot?,

 Well what happened was Sharif Gamal the owner of Soho Properties a member of my congregation has noticed how ourthe need for prayer space has expanded. He felt a commitment to do something for his community. And he found this particular building. And he negotiated it acquired it and offered it for us to use and to establish a center that would be the space for a vision that Ive had for over a decade or 15 almost 20 years which is to establish a space which embodies the fundamental beliefs that we have as Jews Christians and Muslims which is to love our god and to love our neighbor to build a space where well have a culture of worship. And at the same time get to know each other and to forge personal bonds because thats how society how community is built and how we can create something that will snowball to push back against the radical discourse that has just hijacked the discourse in our country and in much of the world.,

 Whats been created has snowballed a little bit. Theres a lot of anger and hostility at that site. And there are many people who have said why not just go somewhere else?,

 I understand the sensitivity of the people. I really do. And Im very very concerned about it. Weve reached out and are still reaching out to 9/11 families.,

 Did you reach out to them before?,

 Yes.,

 To all the families?,

 Not to all the families but to as many as we could reach especially those who are very concerned about this issue.,

 Before you started the proposal?,

 No not before we started but once this thing happened. I need to remind the audience that this story first broke last December in The New York Times. It was a front page article in The New York Times. And no one objected. This controversy only began in May. And it began as a result of some politicians who decided to use this for certain political purposes. And this is when it began to snowball Soledad.,

 So you think its been politicized?,

 Absolutely. This is very dangerous and tragic for two reasons. Reason number one is that it goes against the fundamental American principle of separation of church and state. This concept of separation of religion and politics or church and state has a wisdom behind it. And the purpose behind it is not to politicize religion. Because when you politicize religion it is dangerous.,

 But ultimately when you look at the polls something like 71 percent of Americans think that even though theres a right to build there a center that will include a mosque and other things which well talk about in a minute the wisdom of it may not be there.,

 Well heres the,

 Is that political?,

 Well here,

 Or is that just people saying its sensitivity wise its the wrong thing to do?,

 I am extremely concerned about sensitivity. But I also have a responsibility. If we move from that location the story will be that the radicals have taken over the discourse. The headlines in the Muslim world will be that Islam is under attack. And Im less concerned about the radicals in America than Im concerned about the radicals in the Muslim world.,

 But isnt that also saying youre less concerned about the voices of opposition here?,

 And if we dono no no no. Im sorry I dont mean it that way. I meant it the danger from the radicals in the Muslim world to our national security to the national security of our troops. I have a niece who works in the Army and served in Iraq. The concern for American citizens who live and work and travel overseas will increasingly be compromised if the radicals are strengthened. And if we do move it will strengthen the argument of the radicals to recruit their ability to recruit and their increasing aggression and violence against our country.,

 There are Ground Zero families that Ive spoken to who are on all sides of the debate. I mean theyre not of one voice as you well know. Theyve said but what about me? I cant find my sons body. And they want to build a mosque on a spot where he might be.,

 Well first of all this is not thethis is not that spot. This is not Ground Zero proper. This is,

 Its two blocks.,

 Yes. No ones body is in that location. Im very sensitive to those feelings. As an imam as any religious person does we have to minister to the pain and hurt of our congregations and our ministry and our communities. And it is part of our intention. This is why were reaching out more to 9/11 families. We would like to have a memorial in this center for 9/11 families. Congregations and our ministry and our communities. And it is part of our intention. This is why were reaching out to 9/11 families. We would like to have a memorial in this center for 9/11 families. We have not finalized all our plans yet. We are willing to sit down and engage and do something that will help us heal. You cannot heal a trauma by walking away from it. We have to sit down. We have to talk about it. We have to dialogue about it and find a way to move through it and beyond it.,

 Welcome back everybody. Were talking to Imam Feisal. And well continue our conversation. Did you think this was going to be controversy? Are you surprised?,

 Yes.,

 Really?,

 Yes. As I said the story first came out inlast December in The New York Times. no one objected. ,

 Is it an indication that the bridges youve been building maybe arent such strong bridges and I know you talked about being a bridge builder a lot if you werent aware of the controversy that would follow?,

 Well as I mentioned the story first broke out in last December. It was front page news in The New York Times. No one objected to our establishing such a center. Rabbi Schneider (ph) was quoted. Rabbi Joy Levitt of the Jewish Community Center with whom we had spoken and who welcomed the idea and has given us enormous cooperation and support in telling us what works what doesnt work how to do this. Because the idea Soledad is to establish something like a Muslim Y. you have the YMCA was created 130 years ago to improve relationships between what was then called the American Protestant religions by having young men and young womenof course it was separate at the time YMCA YWCA come and you know bond by doing sports together and other programs together. Its become a worldwide phenomenon. The 92nd street Y was the first attempt by the Jewish community to create also a center where you would create this kind of bonding. We are now today where the Jewish community and the Catholic community was maybe 70 years ago a century ago. And this is our time and our turn to do that. A Christian friend of mine once said you know I have no reason to go to a synagogue. But by going to the 92nd street Y and by doing its programs Ive learned far more about Jewish culture. Gotten to make many Jewish friends. And it has opened my eyes to many things.,

 There have been,

 So we need to do something like this because the need today is to build those types of relationships to forge those bonds that would help us create an atmosphere of peace.,

 But doesnt the controversy that has happened now work against that? Isnt that exactly the opposite of what youre striving for?,

 In some ways yes. But in some ways it also is a silver lining here.,

 How is it a silver lining?,

 It give us an opportunity to speak about this subject in a manner that is sober in a manner that is coherent to look at what we are all about as Americans to look about what it means to be Muslim in America to look at how we are going to put back this genie of clash between the West and Muslim world back into the bottle.,

 There are plenty of Muslims as Ive been doing research who have said this debate does not help us. This debate makes things more dangerous for us. This debate hurts us whats happening at Ground Zero.,

 There is no doubt that this has become such a situation. And Im deeply sensitive to that and very concerned about that. And you know had I known this would happen we certainly would never have done this.,

 You would never have picked that spot?,

 We would not have done something that would create more divisiveness.,

 Then why is it hard to back up and say and now that weve done it lets undo it lets just say we wont. Lets pick another spot thats been offered?,

 As I just mentioned our national security now hinges on how we negotiate this how we speak about it and what we do. It is important for us now to raise the bar on our conversation,

 Whats the risk? When you say national security whats the risk?,

 As I mentioned because if we move that means the radicals have shaped the discourse. The radicals will shape the discourse on both sides. And those of us who are moderates on both sidesyou see Soledad the battle front is not between Muslims and non-Muslims. The real battle front is between moderates on all sides of all the faith traditions and the radicals on all sides. The radicals actually feed off each other. And in some kind of existential way need each other. And the more that the radicals are able to control the discourse on one side it strengthens the radicals on the other side and vice versa. We have to turn this around.,

 Let me play a question from an i-reporter. Her name is Cathy Cortson (ph). And shes in Fullerton California. Lets listen. Why couldnt you find anotheranother place? I just feel like theres an ulterior motive. And I know thats probably wrong but thats how I feel. And I think a lot of Americans feel that way too. That you want to upset us for some reason. Is that true?,

 No its not true. It is not our intention to create more conflict. This is our intention to say we as Muslims we as American Muslims want to contribute to the rebuilding of Lower Manhattan. We want to enhance relationships with our American non-Muslim fellow countrymen. We want to forge better relationships. And we want to be part of the solution. Not only want to be we are ready. We are willing. And we are able to be part of the solution. If the problem is perceived to lie in the Muslim community which definitely a certain amount of that is if the problem is perceived as a matter of religion then wethen the solution also lies in our being engaged in this process. We are not going to achieve peace between the West and the Muslim world without the engagement of Muslims and Western Muslims in particular.,

 You can see the police officer there. That is the location of this proposed Islamic center. I was there yesterday. People carrying placards are walking by. Were back with Imam Feisal. Nice to have you. Feisal excuse me. Nice to have you. Wouldnt it further the goal of peacemaking and youve talked a lot about it to move it? Why is that an option thats of the table now?,

 Nothing is off the table Soledad.,

 Its not off the table?,

 But we are consulting. Were talking to various people about how to do this so that we negotiate the best and the safest option. As I mentioned,

 What are those conversations like? Whats on the table?,

 The biggest issue is the national security issue.,

 How do you pull out without looking like youve lost?,

 Without making it look likewithout making it look both in this country and in the Muslim world. You must remember Soledad and Americans must remember that what we do is watched all over the world all over the world. And we are very engaged with the Muslim world very engaged. And our security is really number one. Our national security our personal security is extremely important. And this issue has become now a national security issue. And therefore in our conversations in our decision making process we have to weigh many many factors and that has been dominant among them.,

 Is there a middle ground that has you pull out of the center and do something else? Thats what it sounds like youre saying. Is it possible?,

 We are discussing many things right now. But you know we havent found yet an option that would work in a safe way.,

 What are what youre considering it?,

 As I said we consider everything in life. But we have to be very cautious here because the voices of the radicals have ratcheted up. And we must make sure that the moderates take over the conversation.,

 In your op-ed in The New York Times a lot of what you talked about were interfaith worship centers.,

 Yes.,

 Its a change from what was on the website originally. Is this a change in the face of the controversy? Is this the negotiation?,

 When I found the Cordoba initiative after 9/11 in response to a perennial question was how can we fix this relationship between the United States and the Muslim world. I found the Cordoba initiative as a multi faith and multinational initiative. Because it became very clear and very apparent that if we were going to do this we have to have Muslims and non-Muslims in this country and internationally cooperating together in addressing the fundamental causes that have caused this and are continuously fuelling this.,

 But the controversial itself,

 So the Cordoba house ,

 though right isnt that causing to some degree an instability and a risk a risk of safety? I mean theres an address now that has become the flash point for a lot of anger. Isnt that a risk to Muslims and Americans?,

 There is a certain anger here no doubt. But if you dont do this right anger will explode in the Muslim world. If this is not handled correctly this crisis could become much bigger than the Danish cartoon crisis which resulted in attacks on Danish embassies in various parts of the Muslim world. And we have a much larger footprint in the Muslim world. If we dont handle this crisis correctly it could become something which could really become very very very dangerous indeed.,

 Do you ask yourself how did you miss that? I mean its been your lifes mission and you and I have spoken in the past years to build bridges and reach out. And yet given what you know now would you have built?,

 As I mentioned it this story is not new. People knew about it.,

 Right but given what you know now would you have said listen lets not do it there? Because it sounds like youre saying in retrospect wouldnt have done it.,

 Well yes.,

 You would not have done it?, 

 If I knew this would happen this would cause this kind of pain I wouldnt have done it. My life has been devoted to peacemaking. There are so many people who say so if youre saying it was a mistake then why cant you get out of it and not do it? Because we have to now make sure that whatever we do actually results in greater peace not in greater conflict.,

 Many of the things that youve said over the last couple of years have been parsed as you well know. Im sure youve read yourself over and over again in over the years. When we come back in the next break were going to talk about some of the things youve said. A 60 Minutes interview with Ed Bradley. Well talk a little bit about Hamas and your position on Hamas as well right after the short break.,

 By all means.,

 Were back talking to Imam Feisal. Thank you for being with us. There are two mosques already in that region of Ground Zero. Yours as you pointed out is about 12 blocks away from the actual Ground Zero what people call the hole in the ground. I live downtown. Ive seen it a lot. Then another one thats just about two blocks away. Why do you think this structures causing all this controversy now?,

 Well theres a certain amount of anti-Islamic sentiment in this country.,

 Why now?,

 And we have seen it in the attacks upon mosques in various parts of the country in the last several weeks. So it is clear that this issue is not just about our center which is an attempt to create peace between Muslims and non-Muslims. This has aroused a certain anti-Islam sentiment which is unfortunate in this country. But we need to look at it. We need to have a discourse about it. We need to make sure this doesnt dominate the discourse between us because Americans believe fundamentally and in a very fundamental and strong way about freedom of religion about separation of governments and churches separation of church and state which means that the powers of the government should not be used to coerce people to believe in any one religion. But it should be used to defend and protect religious rights and freedoms. So this is the conversation we need to have right now.,

 About two weeks after 9/11 you were interviewed by Ed Bradley on 60 Minutes. I want to play a little chunk of how that interview went. There you have said when people run that various snippet that that is taken out of context. Whats the context?,

 Well I was describing the fact that United States had actually worked with the Taliban cooperated with the Mujahadin. The Mujahadin were VIPs in the Reagan White House administration. And Osama bin Laden was something that wethe United States cooperated with in fighting the Soviet Union. However looking back at it right now I realize it was not a very compassionate thing to say and I regret having used those words.,

 But do you believe that U.S. policies led to the World Trade Center being hit by planes by terrorists?,

 Um I ,

 You know theresmaybe shouldntyou feel it wasnt necessary a politic thing to say but do you think its true?,

 Well I mean Osama bin Laden was something you know we had worked with before and we seen what bin Laden did. And the sentiment certainly was bin Laden has shifted and we see what has happened and we have to understand what has happened in order to solve it. But wewethe work that we have to do now is not about pointing fingers.,

 People always say that to me I dont want to point fingers when they dont want to necessarily answer the question which is do you think the U.S. was responsible for those attacks on its own soil by terrorists?,

 I was also trying to sayto share part of my role in bridge building Soledad is like what I do when marital couple comes to me you know when theyve had some discord for counseling. And part of what I have to do is to speak the truth to each side or to tell them when you say this your husband hears that. When you sir when you say this your wife hears that. It is part of my responsibility as a bridge builder to speak the truth about whats great about America what weve done right and what our less glorious moments. And many people feel that the Iraq adventure for example has been one of our less glorious moments. But unless were able to look and speak truthfully and understand the issues then the conversation is going to devolve into a situation where were not going to be able to work and build bridges towards peace. The bigger conversation and the more important one is how do we build peace? Its not that easy.,

 But doesnt that bring us back around to the same thing? Is it how to build peace to put a cultural center Islamic cultural center that will have a mosque that is angering so many people that 71 percent of the country says is not the right thing to do? Is that the right step to peace?,

 First we always said theres going to be a dedicated prayer space for Muslim which we do need. And we want to have prayer space for Christians and for Jews. As I said we have to build on our common platform. We need to buildwe need to make a space which creates and emphasizes a culture of worship. I as a Muslim want you as a Christian to really be a perfect Christian. I want my Jewish friends to be perfect Jews to live according to the highest principles of what it means to be a Jew to be a Christian to be a Muslim.,

 Were back with Imam Feisal. Nice to have you.,

 Thank you.,

 Lets talk about money. A hundred million dollars is the price tag for this Islamic cultural center. Where are you going to get the money?,

 Well we have yet to raise the capital campaign.,

 You have no money for it yet.,

 We have not raised any money for it yet.,

 Where will you get the money?,

 We will raise from whatever source we can domestically especially. And were very transparent on how weve raised the money. This has been something that weve committed ourselves to.,

 Meaning you will list whoever is giving you money.,

 Yes.,

 Will you turn down money from people who say give money to Hamas?,

 Absolutely.,

 No question about it? Anyone who supports Hamas cannot give money to you?,

 We will do whatever is absolutely correct and legal and the safe thing to do.,

 Which means what exactly? I mean because thatsthats an extra condition.,

 You see Im the visionary behind it. Im not the actual builder. Im not the financial expert. Im not the legal expert on these things. But I have a vision here of establishing something which I know in my heart of hearts will be a powerful instrument of peace.,

 Who would you not take money from? Who would you say no take it back? Who would you turn it away from me?,

 We would turn away from anybody who is deemed to be a danger to this process.,

 There have been a lot of questions and I think a fair amount of controversy and criticism about questions that people have had about your take on Hamas. You were asked in an interview in the radio; the interviewer said is the State Department correct in designating Hamas as a terror group? And you dodged the question. You went on a long time. But there was really sort of no answer to it. Soand I guess people sense that whatever that answer is if youif you dont condemn Hamas then in a way maybe youre supporting Hamas as a terror organization. So I guess Id ask that question again. Do youyou know is the State Department right in saying that Hamas is a terrorist organization?,

 I condemn everyone and anyone who commits acts of terrorism. And Hamas has committed acts of terrorism.,

 Lets talk about Islam. I want to play you a chunk of what Franklin Graham a leading Christian has said about your religion. Their goal is world domination. And for the Muslim peace means when all the other nations are subject to Islam. Then we are at peace. The world will be at peace when the entire world is under Islam. Well I dont agree with the teachings of Islam. How do you respond to that?,

 Islam does not preach that at all. And the Koran is quite specific. Koran says whoever believes in God in the last day shall be saved. It is a religion whose very name Islam comes from the word Shalom which means peace. Its about establishing peace. We greet each other with peace be upon you which the Jews do in greeting each other. Its a religion based upon peace. But have there been people who haveyou know Muslims who have expressed such sentiments? Yes they have.,

 The 9/11 hijackers said they were acting in the name of Islam.,

 That is a travesty. That is a travesty. Just as the inquisitors you know in Spain were committing a travesty against the teachings of Jesus Christ. We do have people in our faith community who have committed travesties against the teachings of Islam. This is part of theof theof the war or the battle within Islam today.,

 Had moderate ,

which has to be waged and which is being waged.,

 Have moderate Muslims been vocal enough against extremists?,

 In the Muslim world there are many people who have been vocal and we have been very vocal against extremists. But how to win this battle is an on-going battle. And we must continue to wage the battle for peace.,

 What is the likelihood do you think of another 9/11- type attack here?,

 I hate to think of that. I hate to think of that.,

 But you said security national security is obviously of great concern to you.,

 It is fundamental importance to us. I mean look at what 9/11 did to our country. It traumatized the country. It has created a situation where Muslims are under even greater suspicion. It is important for us toto change that discourse to change that perception. And how do we change this perception Soledad if we dont engage if we dont dialogue if we dont get to know each other?,

 Engaging and dialogue and getting to know each other. Right now its kind of a screaming match in front of a store front.,

 Because the radicals on both have taken over the discourse.,

 But do you thinkagain when you look atwhen you ask your average American 71 percent say they think its a bad idea. The wisdom is not there in doing this. So are those people radicals?,

 No.,

 Are they Islamophobic?,

 No its because people are concerned. People want this problem to go away. I have been in this neighborhood for 25 years. Ill continue to be in this neighborhood after this thing dies down. Mayor Bloomberg was quoted as saying that he believes that the day after election day this story will go away.,

 Do you think thats true?,

 Thats what he said.,

 Do you think thats true?,

 I hope its true. I hope it dies down tomorrow because we need thisthis dangerous discourse to die down. We need to build bridges to build relationships to build friendships and to build a new chapter in Muslim/non-Muslim relations.,

 Is this the right way to do that?,

 How do you propose we do it? How do you pose we really engage? You know Soledad we mustlook this is a matter of engagement right now. How do wehow do we continue engagement is the question.,

 But engagement where people are furious peoplemany people on both sides of the issue are furious. Is that the kind of engagement ,

 I ask what is the solution? What is the solution to create an advancement of peace? We have to advance a discourse on peace. Our politicians get it.,

 Isnt that the opposite of peace? Two sides yelling at each other with placards two blocks from Ground Zero which people I think here in New York and around the country would say that is sacred land. That isthats a special place for everyone in America. Is thatis that a step toward peace there?,

 Well as Clyde Haberman (ph) and many people have said look at what exists in that neighborhood. Look at what exists around the corner.,

 Oh Ibelieve me I live downtown so I know the neighborhood very well. ,

 So lets be clear. Calling this particular block sacred ground and what exists there. Theres you know ,

 Strip clubs and delis. Ive been there a million times. But I think when people call it sacred ground theyre saying something terrible happened on this spot and we cant ,

 Weve got to be fair. You cant say a place that has strip joints is sacred ground. Weve got to be just. Weve got to speak the truth. Weve got to have justice for everybody. Were a country of justice for all not justice for non-Muslims only or some groups and not for others. This is what Americas all about Soledad. Weve got to really mean what we say and say what our values are truly about. This isntthe discourse has been hijacked by people who say no.,

 But in that 71 percent of people those are not extremists.,

 I recognize that. This is why Im on the show with you today. I want to talk to these people show them my face show them what Im about show them my track record. I have been looked at every which way. Every statement has been looked at including that is from 30 years ago when I was a young man. Ive committed myself to this. Let me tell you my story.,

 Im going to have you tell me your story but after the commercial break.,

 Its very important to this particular issue.,

 Well talk about your work with the State Department as well. Were going to take a break and well come back in just a moment. Lets talk a little bit about your past. Youve been working for the State Department or with the State Department for many years under the Bush administration and now as well. What exactly do you do?,

 Well the State Department has a visitors program exchange program where they send people from this country Americans all over the world to talk about things in Latin America and various other subjects. And they also invite people from other parts of the world to visit the United States get to know the United States.,

 Thats a national security mission in a way?,

 Its kind of an exchange visitors program to getto build relationships between people in various professions religions et cetera with their counterparts with other people in other parts of the world. Ive done about half a dozen of these to various parts of the Muslim world.,

 Youve heard about this pastor in Florida Terry Jones who is proposing burning Korans on 9/11. What do you think of that?,

 I would plead with him to seriously what he is doing.,

 Why?,

 Its going to feed into the radicals of the Muslim world. Its dangerous. General Petraeus has said that. It is something that is not the right thing to do on that ground.,

 Do you think he has a right to do it?,

 And more importantlyand more importantlywell we have freedom in this country freedom of speech. But with freedom comes responsibility. And a famous saying to shot fire in a crowded theater. This is dangerous for our national security but also its the un-Christian thing to do. Jesus Christ didnt teach us to do that. We Muslims have awe look to the example of our prophet. Many Christians say what would Jesus do? Jesus taught us to turn the other cheek. Jesus taught us to love your enemy. We are not your enemies. But this is what Jesus taught us to do. And I would like to suggest that you know we all have to live by the highest principles of our faith traditions. As I mentioned its importantI want Christians to liveto be perfected Christians and I want Muslims to be perfected Muslims and Jews to be perfected Jews. If we dont do that if we judge each other by the worst of the others behavior and by the best of our own where are we going?,

 We have time for one last question with Imam Feisal. Can you unequivocally say were going to build this Islamic Center/Mosque at this location two blocks from Ground Zero?,

 We certainly hope to build the Cordoba House vision of a multi-faith center that will build relationships between Muslims and non-Muslims.,

 There?,

 On this night my Jewish friends are celebrating Rosh Hashanah and I wish to wish them a happy Rosh Hashanah including Larry King on whose show we are on tonight and to wish them well. And in this peace in this team we need to build peace. Peace is the name of our religion. Peace is how Muslims and Jews create each other. And Jesus Christ said blessed are the peace makers for they shall be called the children of God. 

 That opens tomorrow. For Colored Girls. How did this move come about for you?,

 Let me so. I heard that giggle that you just did.,

 You like my giggle? Its kind of a turn on huh?,

 You got a lot of nerve. How did this come about for me?,

 Yes.,

 When I was shooting Why Did I Get Married 2 we were at the tail end of shooting it and there was a production of For Colored Girls in Atlanta and Tyler wanted me to see the play with him. We went to the play and I really enjoyed it and he said you know they want me -- theyve asked me to direct and write this for the big screen. I said oh thats awesome are you going to do it? And he said Im thinking about it. He said so -- I brought you because I am thinking of -- I would like for you to be a part of this. I said oh this is why we came. He goes why else did you think I brought you to see this play with me? I said I thought oh two friends hanging out having a good time. So thats how it actually came about.,

 Hes a great guy by the way.,

 Hes wonderful.,

 Fun to work with.,

 Yes.,

 By the way Janet Jackson has a hit album out called The Best Of. You can get that anywhere. You play Jo. Tell me about her?,

 Jo. Joanna Bradmore. She runs her all fashion mag. Shes very very -- a very successful woman. She comes from the ghetto with the rest of the girls. Reside -- she has worked really hard to make her way out of that. Shes very shrewd.,

 Shes the most successful of the group?,

 Shes -- yes she is the successful one and will do anything to stay away from that life. She wants no part of it whatsoever. Shes really shrewd bold. Her color is red. Shes very fierce. She has no room for niceties. Shes a kind of a bitch.,

 Do you like her or not like her?,

 I like her very much.,

 Is this a comedy?,

 No.,

 Not at all?,

 Its -- everyones been talking about how intense it is.,

 When you saw the play.,

 Yes.,

 Did you think of yourself as Jo?,

 No I was just enjoying watching these women in this play who did an incredible job. And Jasmine Guy who actually had directed the play the production that I saw. No I didnt at all. I didnt see my --,

 So when he said he wanted you for it did you think Jo would be the part?,

 Well I didnt know what he -- what part he wanted me to play. So when he actually called me up and said that the script is coming along and told me a little bit about my character I thought this is really interesting. This is really different from anything that I have ever done. And I thought well this is going to be a challenge. And when I actually read the script I thought wow this is really cool. So I was up for the challenge.,

 What was it like doing it?,

 I loved it. It was -- it was intense. It was very very very intense on a daily basis. Like I said shes no BS she has no room for niceties. So every single day of shooting was tough. It was really tough and especially what shes going through with her husband her home life and as well as her relationship with herself.,

 Its interesting because you were born Janet Demeta Jo Jackson. Right? So now youre Jo again?,

 Yes. Actually her original name in the script Tyler called her Carmen. And I wanted to change her name to Jo. I thought Carmen was a little too sweet and her full name Joanna which is softer but just to call her Jo that toughness that little toughness.,

 When you said youre red in this what do you mean youre red? ,

 Each woman has a color. For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide When the Rainbow Is Enuf. Each woman has a color that represents their personality their character. My color happens to be red which you know gives a little bit of insight of -- to who I am what Im like. Theres another woman Loretta Devine shes -- her color is green. Anika Noni Rose. All the women are wonderful. Absolutely wonderful in this film. Shes yellow. So every woman has their color that represents to a certain degree who they are.,

 Whats Tyler Perry like to work for? Hes a great guest.,

 Youve had him on your show yes.,

 Yes.,

 Hes wonderful. I enjoy working with Tyler. Its -- theres a sense of family that togetherness that bond that closeness which I love coming from a big family. His sets are always fun always very enjoyable. Even though with this it was a little different because it was so intense on a daily basis. But still I enjoyed being there every single day coming to work.,

 How do you think it will do commercially?,

 Well I hope. And --,

 But its getting great word about it.,

 I -- yes. It is -- its getting a great word of mouth. And I hope it does well. I think it will do well. I think this movie is not just for colored -- women of color its for all women. All walks of life. I think you will find as a woman a part of yourself or someone you used to be or someone you know in one of these women. Theres a couple of women that I see the old me in.,

 How about men will men like it?,

 I think they will for sure. I think theres a lot for them to learn. Its not just about women its about their relationships. Whether its their husbands boyfriends men that theyre --,

 Semi-involved with.,

 Exactly. Theres a lot. Its really a great story in the way Tyler has infused his words with Ntozake Shange the poet with her work because this was an award winning Broadway play back in the 70s.,

 Heavy.,

 Its a really intense film. And Omari Hardwick plays my husband. Hes wonderful in this film.,

 Kerry Washington is in it. Phylicia Rashad is in it. Our friend Whoopi Goldberg. Thandie Newton. But you said you didnt interact with them a lot. Off the set.,

 Its great.,

 Why not?,

 Staying in character. Wanting to --,

 You do? You did that?,

 Yes. Really wanting to stay in character during the duration every moment even when he said cut of filming. And like I said she wants nothing to do with the ghetto.,

 With the rift-raft.,

 And her past life. She worked too hard to get out of that. And keeping these walls up. So I would hear the girls in there cackling and talking and part of me wanted to be a part of that. But to remain true to the character I stayed away.,

 So when you stay in character -- many great actors have told me they do that -- did you also bring it home?,

 There are times when you do. You dont just walk away from it. There were times when my friends would say theres something different about you the tone in your voice. And Tyler actually wanted to play it with my tone imposed and make it a little lower tone. And I told him let me try it let me try it first on my own and see what happens. And so he liked what I did so he just left it at that.,

 You like acting?,

 I love it.,

 Why?,

 This is my first passion. This is my --,

 More than singing?,

 This is what I signed up to do when I was a kid. This is my first job. When I was 10 years old. Singing was my second job.,

 And dancing as you know was third. You know we were a great couple.,

 Yes. Yes. We have got our moves.,

 But acting is first?,

 Well this is what I did. This is what I originally did. And this is what I just knew for sure I wanted to grow up and go to school study business law study acting and become an actress.,

 So what veered off? How did the singing come?,

 My father.,

 Yes?,

 Yes. And its you know the family business. He told me that he wanted me to sing.,

 So he said it and you had to do it?,

 Kind of. For the most part yes. And its been -- Im not complaining its been wonderful for me and I really enjoyed. I love performing. And --,

 You still sing?,

 Yes. And its in my blood but this is -- Im finally getting around to doing something that Ive wanted to do since I was a kid making films.,

 So you want to do more of this?,

 Of course Im going to.,

 Would you like to do a play?, 

 I would love to do that. Thats always -- thats been another dream of mine to do a Broadway play. An award winning Broadway play.,

 Are you still touring?,

 At the moment no. I may do a little private thing here a little private thing there but as of going on a tour no.,

 What about with your brothers?,

 No.,

 Your sister?,

 No.,

 So Janet goes it her own way? Can I say that?,

 I guess so.,

 All right in a recent Jet magazine article you said that in the past you have not had a lot of friends. Is that a correct quote?,

 I dont have a lot of friends.,

 Why?,

 Its not easy in this industry. And Im glad I dont have a lot of friends.,

 Is it a trust issue?,

 Yes. Its very much a trust issue. Im happy with the people that I have around me. And theyve been friends of mine since I was young for a very long time.,

 So new people dont come into Janet Jacksons life easily?,

 Not really. Its definitely a trust issue for myself.,

 Were back with Janet Jackson. For Colors Girls opens as they say wide tomorrow. Major Broadway hit. Could be a major vehicle as a film as well. With all your talents your achievements your celebrity the fact that its hard for you to make few friends do you think you intimidate people?,

 You know theres a line in the song All For You that talks about intimidation. And when I was at the time dating guys really not -- wanting to approach me but not approaching me and me inviting them to approach me. But its that intimidation that will always get in the way. And Ive been told that.,

 Do you date now?,

 Im actually seeing someone.,

 Can you tell us about it?,

 No.,

 No?,

 Hes a very private man. So I respect --,

 We respect that too. Only -- I only will ask is he in the business?,

 No.,

 Does that make it easier? The fact that hes not?,

 Easier?,

 Well by the fact that youre not clashing --,

 I am enjoying the fact that hes not in the business. But I dont know if it makes things easier.,

 OK. Going back to music some of your fans -- and weve covered this -- has asked me today in fact have you abandoned music?,

 No. Not at all.,

 So straighten this out. You will sing?,

 Yes. Just because Ive made two films back to back its seems like I said before its always been a dream of mine to do something like this so I kind of put music on the back burner to do this. And I will continue to do more films. But definitely I cant give up music its in my blood. And I love love love performing. So I will make more music. I think I have thought to go into the studio and just take my time fool around next year.,

 How about a musical film?,

 I would love to do that.,

 Combine both.,

 I would love to do that. Theres a lot of things that I want to do and that Im going to do.,

 All right. I bet when you saw Dream Girls you would have thought I could have played in that.,

 I enjoyed that a great deal. I did see that. Never saw it on Broadway. But yes I saw the film.,

 OK. Youve written a book. Called True You. Its due out in January.,

 Yes.,

 The title explain that.,

 True You. People have asked me about the weight loss the weight gain the workout regimen the nutrition and instead of writing just about that I wanted to take it to the very beginning of what may have brought all of that on. So that took me back to my childhood and I had self esteem issues. And its not an auto biography but there are anecdotes little anecdotes throughout my life beginning from my childhood up until now and it allows you to see what may have caused telling my little stories. You know my dream is to really not appeal to adults but to appeal to children as well as teens and hopefully they will relate to one of my stories or I have stories as well of fans that have written to me. So I have put some of those stories in. And hopefully they can relate to one of those stories and itll be able to help them in some way.,

 Its designed as a kind of help people book?,

 Its a self-help book so its about being who you are and learning to love yourself as you are. The True You.,

 You had an early weight problem?,

 Yes I did. It was a body image issue. I was so self- conscious at a very --,

 So when you look to the mirror you didnt like yourself?,

 And I was told certain things that Im too this Im too that. I should be more like this more like that. At a very very young age. When I did Good Times I was just 10 years old. And they never discussed with me ahead of time. But I remember my first episode. One of the wardrobe women she bound my chest because I was developing at a very young age and they thought you know I was a guess a little too big for my age. So that immediately translated to me that I wasnt good enough. The way that I was. So it was little things like that that really affect a child.,

 Did you have it all through your teenaged years?,

 For sure. For sure. I did until -- you know I was the kind of person that internalized everything. I held everything in. And it wasnt until I opened up and spoke to someone who I really felt that I could communicate with who would not judge me who I could truly trust that my life began to change and that was much later on in my life.,

 Was a doctor?,

 No. He -- I -- he wants to remain anonymous. But Ive spoken about him before. Hes -- I call him a cowboy. He is actually a cowboy.,

 Still in your life?,

 Yes. We still talk.,

 Janet Jackson what a performer. What a star. Her new movie For Colored Girls opens tomorrow all across the United States. Her book will be out in January. Lots of things happening as always in her life. Theres always something happening in Janet Jacksons life. How do you feel about your body now by the way when you look in the mirror? Are you happy with Janet?,

 Im the happiest Ive actually ever been in my life at this very moment. And I still have my days. Im a work in progress. I still have my days where -- theyre not the greatest and I have my moments of -- where I feel really really good. So its still a work in progress for me.,

 You dont feel overweight though do you?,

 No I dont but I can definitely tighten things up for sure.,

 You described your new short hairstyle as liberating. I like it but why is it liberating?,

 It was just like shedding all the old skin. Its not the first time I have cut all of my hair off. I have done it several times before. But its the first time that Ive done it since the whole Internet craze so everyone made a big to-do really about me cutting my hair. But it was liberating. It was freeing. And its easy.,

 You did it yourself? No one said do it?,

 Did somebody tell you to do it? No Ive been wanting to do it for a while. I always get bored with my hair. Thats why I would always change it throughout my career. And I guess people thought its just for this project that Ive had. It was really me being bored. When I was a kid I would get bored with my hair and Id walk around with pink hair one moment then blue hair another moment.,

 You are an interesting person.,

 Just being a kid.,

 Would you say of all the Jacksons youre the most complicated?,

 The most rebellious. Myself and my brother Randy. The babies of the family.,

 The two babies?,

 Yes.,

 Are the most rebellious?,

 I would say so.,

 Does the family accept this? Your dad and your mom? They all accept this? The brothers?,

 Theyre so tired.,

 What?,

 To the point -- you have nine kids by the time the babies come around its like go ahead.,

 Is it true you were very honest in the book?, 

 Yes.,

 Was that hard sometimes to write?,

 There were a lot of things that I actually had dealt with already and I thought OK.,

 Let it out?,

 Im over that. Like you know its easy to talk about. Its easy to write about but when I started to write about certain things that I hadnt spoken about in a while feelings started to resurface and I said to myself oh theres still something there that is connecting very deeply with me and emotions started to flow a little bit. So it was very therapeutic.,

 Its catharsis.,

 Yes.,

 Do you keep a diary?,

 No.,

 Personal journal no?,

 No my albums have been my diaries.,

 We know that in the world of show business sometimes too much too soon has a long lasting affect. And a lot of kid stars are never heard from again. How do you think you avoided that? Because you got a lot of attention as a kid. Its got to play something with your head.,

 I was really really fortunate. I think it has a lot to do with who you surround yourself with your upbringing how grounded your parents make sure you continue to be or are from day one and continuing that all the way up into your adult hood. And that goes a long way. And your faith in God having that as a foundation as well I think all of that is the reason why I didnt get into any drama. And Im thankful. Im very fortunate.,

 Were you ever tempted?,

 No.,

 Never did? Never got into that scene?,

 No.,

 All right tell me about the It Gets Better campaign which I understand supporting gay youth.,

 The Trevor Project.,

 What got you involved?,

 You know I first heard about the Trevor Project years ago from a makeup artist who became a wonderful friend of mine. Hes no longer around me. Rest in peace Kevin Quant (ph). And he supported them. And he would always talk to me about this organization. I wanted to get involved. Being one of those kids who could truly relate holding everything inside like I was telling you internalizing everything. And that really can affect you and feeling helpless and hopeless and finding that person that you can trust that adult like I did later on in life that I felt comfortable and safe to tell my issues my worries my pains my aches to. This is what the Trevor Project is really all about. And they have a 24-hour hotline.,

 Its for bullying right?,

 Yes. For the -- definitely especially with whats been going on just recently what has happened. Its sad. They have a 24- hour hotline. The number is 866-For-You-Trevor. And they have a website TheTrevorProject.org. And theres someone there that you can speak with 24 hours that will be there for you.,

 We did a whole program about bullying about the Trevor Project. I know you have studied it. Youve looked into it. Were you ever bullied?,

 No.,

 Do you understand why people bully? ,

 I think it really says more about themselves how they feel about themselves. Theres something about themselves I feel that doesnt set right something -- whether they hate they dislike something that may be going on issues at home with their parents. Who knows what it is? But its something going on inside of them. And I think its them lashing out.,

 One can only -- it must be terrible to have a -- to be gay and hold it in be afraid.,

 Not be able to be true you.,

 Yeah.,

 No really. To be proud of who you are. Everyone should be. You should never hide your true self.,

 But it comes from teaching doesnt it? Were taught to hate.,

 Yes were not born that way. And thats so unfortunate that adults teach us to hate. Its sad.,

 Thats the Trevor Project right?,

 Yes the Trevor Project.,

 Give me the number again.,

 Its 866-For-You-Trevor. A 24-hour hotline there will always be someone for you to talk to.,

 Youre being bullied --,

 Yes someone to just open up and tell just everything you can pour out to.,

 By the way if youre a bully or if you have those tendencies you can call too?,

 Yes of course.,

 Theyll try to help you in every way.,

 Of course.,

 You have a greatest hits CD out called Janet Jackson Number One Icon. How do you feel about that title? Its a little self- crediting isnt it? Did you title that album?,

 No I didnt title it. No I didnt title that. There was one before this that was just called Janet Jackson Number Ones and it had 33 of -- all 33 number ones and the new single a bonus track that wound up becoming a number one. So it was 34 in all.,

 You have had 34 number ones?,

 Yes.,

 Thirty four number ones?,

 Yes.,

 Theres talk that could be Oscar?,

 It would be nice.,

 Would you sing it on the Awards show?,

 I dont think they do that anymore.,

 No they dont. Thats right. They dont do the songs. You wrote that song.,

 I wrote that with Jermaine Dupri yes.,

 When -- does writing come easily to you?,

 For the most part yes. Its so funny because I remember when I was a kid -- I started writing when I was nine years old. I wrote my very first song when I was nine.,

 What was the song?,

 Fantasy is the title. I remember being a kid and my brother Randy my brother Mike and myself we have our chores to do after dinner especially I remember one night in particular I was doing dishes I think Mike was sweeping the floor. And Randy was cleaning off the tables and all the counter tops. And thats how we would always create music. We could come up with melodies and then we would add lyrics to them. And we would sing a three part harmony. We were very young. But its good practice.,

 Where did this new song come from?,

 Nothing?,

 Yes.,

 From the movie. I had ask Tyler if he had a theme song for the movie and he said no. I told him I would love to give it a go if he wouldnt mind. I viewed the movie twice with Jermaine. And then Jermaine and I just went into his studio and we created this and presented it to Tyler. I didnt know if he would like it or not. I was hoping he would. And he loved it. So it was really from the characters in the film.,

 It fits the film?,

 Perfectly.,

 Because sometimes youll see songs that dont even pay attention to the film.,

 No this was written for the film and watching those characters.,

 Were not going to dwell on this because it is too much a part of a sad past. But you said you that you learned of Michaels death while you were filming in Atlanta for Tyler Perrys other movie Why Did I Get Married II. You said focused on work and work helped you through grief. How?,

 Actually I -- they were already shooting. I hadnt started shooting just yet. But I was supposed to start in a few days. And I was at home in New York when I learned of my brothers passing.,

 How did you learn?,

 I got a call and there was something on TV on CNN.,

 You never get through that.,

 No.,

 You said in a recent interview you spent a lot of time feeling lonely even when you have people around you all the time. Can you explain that? Lonely in a crowd?,

 Yes that is -- that was the worst for me. Theres nothing worse than being lonely and having people around you especially people that you love people that you need to be involved with. It was very very sad for me. And Im not going to say anything more about that Larry than that.,

 No I dont want to -- you work hard though dont you? Youre working like all the time?,

 I enjoy working. I love to work. I love to keep busy. Dont get me wrong I love my little down time too. I love being on an island and a get away or being with my family or being with that person that I spend my life with and just relaxing by an ocean by the beach. 

 Do you miss marriage? You were married once?,

 I was married twice.,

 Twice. Do you miss it?,

 Are you getting around to something? Is there something you want to ask me?,

 No.,

 You trying to propose. No Im just joking.,

 OK whats next? You said you would like to do a Broadway thing.,

 Yes I would for sure. And Im eventually going to because like I said thats always been a dream of mine since I was a kid. When Im that attached that passionate about something I dont let go of it. It might be a minute before I get to it. But I dont let go of it.,

 I would imagine since many people in the Broadway business watch this show that would be intriguing to them too. Do you think you would like doing matinees and evenings and eight shows a week?,

 You know a friend of mine was on Broadway and he told me that. He said its very --,

 Wednesday matinee.,

 He said its grueling. He said its a whole other discipline. And thats what --,

 Attracted you.,

 Yes that whole other discipline my brain went ding ding ding; whats that like? I want to experience that see what thats about. It just seems like it would be just so much fun to be able to perform on a daily basis. Thats a whole other grind that I have never experienced but someday I will.,

 Because when you do a movie its stop and go right?,

 Yes.,

 What music do you listen to?,

 All kinds. My favorite is -- what I grew up on was jazz and Brazilian. That was my love.,

 Bossa Nova?,

 Yes. Maria -- Maria Bethania Ky Televaloso (ph).,

 Paula Shovey (ph)?,

 Yes Jiberta Gile (ph). Nasamento (ph),

 Anthony Hepbare (ph).,

 Yes. You say -- youre --,

 The Girl from Ipanema?,

 I love that Astrid.,

 Stan Getz?,

 Yes. Joelle Jiberto (ph) I love her version -- or his version with Stan Getz. And shes on that --,

 Yes.,

 Yes.,

 What do you think of Lady Gaga?,

 I love her.,

 Because?,

 I enjoy her music. I feel that she came along and she introduced something a little bit different for the people of today. For myself its -- and I dont mean this in a negative way at all. It -- its a little reminiscent of Grace Jones how big how out there her costumes are how loud how strong. And I mean that in a very complimenting way.,

 How good a singer is she?,

 I think shes very talented. She writes her own music. I think she has a wonderful voice. And I had the opportunity of meeting her for the first time. Was it last year? But I knew of her before she became the Lady Gaga that everyone --,

 Where did you meet her?,

 I met her at a concert of hers. And her story I thought was incredible. And when I knew of this artist I was really pulling for her before she had gotten this recording contract.,

 You were on the finale of American Idol.,

 Yes.,

 Earlier this year with my dear friend Ryan Seacrest.,

 Yes.,

 What do you think of that show and the impact its had on the industry?,

 Its so huge. ,

 Amazing.,

 I think its a wonderful outlet for finding fresh talent new talent. And its fun to watch. Because I work like crazy I mean I watch here and there but I enjoy it. But I enjoy it. When I do watch I always enjoy it.,

 Im told -- I knew this lady great lady -- that youd like to do a film The Life of Eartha Kitt. There was no one like her.,

 I had the opportunity of getting to know her. Just before she passed we were getting to know one another. And I was fortunate enough to spend some time with her. And I saw her at Carnegie. And I was -- she had a performance in September of that year that I -- she wanted me to come and see her. And I wanted to. It just so happens that something came up and I had to work and I couldnt make it. And I -- I absolutely -- I still love her.,

 She remains sexy late in life.,

 And how -- the way she performed that night when I saw her she blew me away. And all the different languages.,

 Oh.,

 Was it like eight? All the languages just amazing. I love Santa Baby.,

 Put the sable under the tree for me. You said youre proud you remained true to yourself. But the self also changes. Have you been true to every change?,

 Ive tried to be. We evolve as life goes on and as we get older. And Ive tried to keep that -- keep that truth within me always.,

 Is it -- do you think theres something hard about being a Jackson?,

 It has its pros and its cons. And I think thats with anything with anyone.,

 Yeah but its a label too. Right?,

 It can make things easy. It can also make things difficult.,

 You keep on keeping on girl.,

 But Im very proud of who I am and my family --,

 You ought to be.,

 -- and my last name. I wear it proudly.,

 We only go back -- well almost 30 years. B.B. thats his nickname but I have to refer to him as Prime Minister Netanyahu because thats formality here. Benjamin Netanyahu the Israeli prime minister in New York a city he knows very well used to be ambassador to the U.N. Lets get right to it. Its good seeing you again by the way.,

 Good to see you Larry. You didnt have to reveal how far back we go together.,

 Thats right you got a point. A few months ago you went to the White House. It didnt go too well. What changed yesterday?,

 I think theres an underlying relationship there that people dont appreciate. We have our ups and downs. People focus on the downs and the downs are exaggerated and sometimes distorted. But there is ups and theres a basic bedrock of identification common values between Israel and the United States. The president gives it expression. I give it expression. And yesterdays meeting gave it expression. I think there is a solidity of ties between Israel and the United States that the president of the United States and the prime minister of Israel reflect in their meeting.,

 No matter who holds the posts?,

 I think every prime minister every president has his own points his own viewpoints but theres a common position of friendship and a basic alliance that is there that really is continued by all leaders whoever they are. That was definitely the case yesterday.,

 Mr. Prime Minister have there been times though since President Obama took office where you felt that friendship or that tie weakened?,

 No a lot of things that the public is not aware of that throughout the year and some that Ive been in office weve had continuous cooperation in the fields of security in the fields of intelligence in the fields of vital strategic importance to Israel and the United States. And that seems to go unnoticed or unremarked. People always focus on differences of views that we may have. Theyre minor compared to the things that unite us. We have -- Israel is the only democracy in the Middle East. Americas the worlds greatest democracy. We have both common values and unfortunately common enemies. The people who attack the United States and the Middle East attack Israel. The people that we are fighting are the people you are fighting. So theres a great commonalty a great cooperation that goes underneath the surface. And sometimes Im happy to say it does come to the surface. It did yesterday. It really should be an indication of something that guides our relationship throughout.,

 So theres no time that you question President Obamas commitment to your country?,

 No. And I think theres no time that he questioned Israels unwavering commitment as a firm American ally. I would say there is no greater ally no greater friend of the United States than Israel. And there is no greater friend and no greater ally of Israel than the United States.,

 There were those who were saying though in the past few months until that meeting yesterday the relationships were at the lowest they have been in 35 years. Do you buy that?,

 Look no I dont. I think the support for Israel and the American people and the intertwining of interests and cooperation between our governments is increasing all the time. Its obscured by the bumps on the road. But theres no question that the road is going forward and going upwards I have no doubt about that.,

 All right lets get into some things. Mr. Prime Minister you say that you want to have direct talks with the Palestinians. So when are you and President Abbas the Palestinian Authority going to sit down? Whens it going to happen? Its so frustrating to the world -- ,

 Thats a very -- thats an excellent question that Ive been asking for a year and a quarter ever since I got into office. On day one that I got in I said President Abbas the Palestinian president meet me and lets talk peace. And I use this forum today on the Larry King show to say President Abbas meet me and lets talk peace. We all have our grievances. We all have our you know our questions and things that we want answered. But the most important thing is to get together sit down in a room and begin to negotiate peace. You cannot resolve a conflict you cannot successfully complete a peace negotiation if you dont start it.And I say lets start it right now today tomorrow in Jerusalem in Ramallah or anywhere else. Im prepared to go to a warm city like New York or a cool city anywhere. Lets get on with the business of talking peace and concluding the peace agreement.,

 So forgive me whats holding it up? He could watch this show. We did a show some years ago with Arafat with Yitzhak Rabin and King Hussein of Jordan a historic show. I was in Washington. The three of them were in their homelands. It was terrific. Why cant -- would you do that if we had you and Abbas and we had the king of Jordan on? Could we do that now?,

 Youre on Larry. From my point of view immediately no problem.,

 All right. So if we worked on that we could set it up? Because its -- its frustrating -- go ahead.,

 Well Im just saying that youre hitting the nail right on the head. I mean what is there to prevent a meeting between the prime minister of Israel in Jerusalem and the president of the Palestinian Authority Mahmoud Abbas whos 10 minutes away in Ramallah thats when you have traffic. Without traffic its seven minutes. I really like and respect Senator George Mitchell President Obamas envoy to the Middle East. But I find it perplexing and unnecessary that president -- that Senator Mitchell has to travel halfway across the world to relay messages between President Abbas and myself. Theres no need for that. We should sit down. We have very serious issues to discuss. Our security the question of where the borders will end up the question of settlements the question of Palestinian refugees the question of water. All these things are crucially important. The only way that theyre going to be resolved is if we actually sit down and negotiate a peace. I think leaders have to do exactly that. I think we have to break molds break stereotypes and cut right through to a solution. Im prepared to do it. Im prepared to lead. And I hope that President Abbas hears my call responds to it. I think well have important and steady help from President Obama. But there is no substitute for the two leaders. The leader of Israel and the leader of the Palestinian Authority to get down together talk peace and make peace.,

 And we can kick it off on this show. Well be right back with Benjamin Netanyahu the Israeli prime minister. Dont go away. Were back with Prime Minister Netanyahu. He is in New York. Were in Los Angeles. What about the settlements issue? President Obama said yesterday he expected talks to begin before the moratorium on settlement construction expires which is late September. Will you extend the moratorium by the way if things arent settled by late September?,

 Larry the whole settlement issue was supposed to be discussed in the final peace -- what are called final status peace negotiations which means how to achieve a final peace. This is one of the issues we have to resolve. Seven months ago I did something quite extraordinary that is no other prime minister in Israels history did this. I put on a temporary freeze of 10 months of new construction in the settlements in order to encourage the Palestinians to get into the peace talks. Seven months have passed by. They dont come in. They say oh we need now another extension. And the answer is right now listen we dont need any pretext and preconditions. Lets just get into the talks. And one of the things well discuss right away is issues of settlements. And thats what I propose doing. In any case what is important is to get down and talk. Thats the important thing.,

 President Clinton once said to me that the difficulties in the Middle East are harder to solve than Ireland/England. That its so deep rooted and so frustrating. Can you explain to a waiting world why you cant get together?,

 I can and Im offering to do exactly that. I think theres been a persistent refusal in many Arab quarters to recognize the state of Israel borders. I think the issue of borders is important. Its related to our security. But the issue of recognition the basic recognition of the Jewish state that exists in the Middle East that is the homeland of the Jewish people that lives in peace and security with its neighbors is something that is recognized by some. We made peace with Egypt. We made peace with Jordan. I think its important to make peace with the Palestinians. And Im prepared to negotiate that peace right away. I think it requires courage on the Palestinian side for all those who dont really want a peace with Israel to stand up and do what president -- the late president of Egypt Anwar Sadat did and to say hey its over no more war no more bloodshed. Were going to make a genuine peace with Israel. Im prepared to have a demilitarized Palestinian state live next to the Jewish state of Israel. I think the Palestinians should not be either subject of Israel or citizens of Israel. They should have their own independent country. And we should be assured that this country is not used as a staging ground for Iranian-sponsored terrorist attacks on us. And I think this combination of state for the Palestinians and security for Israel is something that can be brought about in direct negotiations that I propose to start without any preconditions without any pretext.,

 Right.,

 Leaders dont need excuses. They just have to get on with it and Im prepared to get on with it.,

 Do you -- you absolutely favor a Palestinian state though right?,

 I do. And I want to make sure that it -- that we dont have a repeat of what happened in the other two times that we vacated territory. You know we left Lebanon every last square inch of it. And Iran came in and used it as a staging ground to launch 6000 rockets on Israels cities 6000. We left Gaza last square inch and Iran used it to arm its proxies and fired another 6000 rockets. So we cant afford that happening a third time. Now when I say that Larry you can now reach one of two conclusions. Either dont make any peace attempt or ensure that the peace you do make has the necessary security arrangements on the ground to prevent this from happening a third time. Thats what I propose to do. And I think its possible to fashion a secure peace for Israel and a dignified peace and a dignified life for the Palestinians. I discussed this at some length yesterday with President Obama. And Im very happy with the progress of those talks.,

 All right. But Abbas isnt the only leader we have to concern ourselves with. Would you sit down with Hamas?,

 Ill sit down with anyone who will recognize my existence. Somebody who calls for our destruction my destruction is unfortunately not a partner for peace.,

 So you would not sit down --,

 -- Hamas that calls -- well you know would you sit down with somebody who said we want to destroy the United States? Now come and talk to us?,

 Do you think they can -- that can change at all? Do you think theres some way -- Secretary Mitchell Senator Mitchell maybe somewhat in between can get a little tempering of the language? I mean were trying for the same result here. Nobody gets killed hopefully.,

 I think in the case of Hamas its basically a proxy a terror proxy of Iran. Iran openly calls for our destruction. It denies the Holocaust. It sponsors terrorism everywhere. It brutalizes its own people. Hamas by the way does the same thing to the Palestinians in Gaza. They dont really have a choice. They cant really vote the Hamas out. They cant decide their own fate. But look at what is happening in the West Bank with our cooperation. You know we removed -- I removed hundreds of check points hundreds of road blocks. And the Palestinian economy on the West Bank is just booming. I mean theres coffee shops theres shopping malls theres e-businesses you name it. Its growing at about 8 percent or 9 percent a year which isnt bad these days. And Im very happy for that. And I want to add on to that a formal peace -- peace with security and prosperity. Hamas is totally the other way around. They are -- you know theyre subjecting their own people to terrible things. And theyre using the territory to just stockpile weapons. I wish they -- I wish theyd change and I wish theyd accept the state of Israel. But as long as they call for our destruction theres not much we can do.,

 Well be right back with the prime minister of Israel after this. Were back with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of the state of Israel. Your coalition we know this has some right wingers who dont agree with the notion of a Palestinian state. You have some difficulties. There are always inner politics going on. Is there any way a pragmatic way to bring you and the Kadima together?,

 Well Ive called for a national unity Ive formed one. Ive formed Likud labor alliance. And Im always happy to broaden it to people who want to serve the nation. You know getting into the intricacies of Israeli politics would take a lot more of -- even a long program of Larry King. Its a subject of encyclopedic advantage.,

 Back to the difficulties. In May Israeli forces stormed a ship on a humanitarian mission to Gaza. Several Turkish activists were killed. I dont know if youve -- have you ever publicly said that you were wrong to do this?,

 Well we were definitely sorry about the loss of life. But Ill tell you what happened. First of all why do we check ships that go to Gaza? Because we are concerned with the flow of -- the possible flow of weaponry into Gaza. Weve had as I said thousands of rockets fired on us. I think that what people fail to recognize is that there were six ships. Five of them were totally peaceful and nothing of substance happened. Our navy checked these ships. And we didnt have any incident. The sixth ship was very different. It had about 500 people on it of which about 450 were peaceful people. But several dozen were activists of a very radical group that had apparently amassed steel rods knives communication equipment. They boarded differently than the other passengers the other 450 passengers boarded in one port in Turkey. They went through security checks. These people boarded in another port in Istanbul. They didnt go through any security checks. They had their own communication equipment. They had their own -- their own steel pipes and things that they brought on board. And when our Coast Guard effectively wanted to check this ship and make sure that it behaved the way the other five did they were brutally attacked. You can see that in the films that were released. Our soldiers our navy people were fighting for their lives. What would you do if the Coast Guard boarded a ship and the Coast Guard was brutally attacked by people who were you know clubbing them knifing them taking weapons from them shooting at them? What do you think would happen? How do you think the American people would respond?,

 OK. But how do you repair the damage with a state you need to be friendly Turkey?,

 Well youre quite right that Turkey and Israel had an important relationship. Turkeys a very important country in the Middle East. I think that the relationship began to deteriorate with the Turkish policy a new policy that basically veers away from the West and I think Israel -- what has happened with Israel as a result of that policy and not its cause. But nevertheless I look for every opportunity to see if we can stop this deterioration and somehow get things back to normal or relatively normal. Last week I authorized a meeting with one of my senior ministers and the Turkish foreign minister. They met in Zurich in the airport. I cant tell you that something positive came out of it. But I want to feel as prime minister of Israel that I leave no stone unturned in the quest for -- the quest for a broader peace and the quest of good relations with our neighbors. And even though it may not succeed right now well keep trying.,

 Will you meet with Turkish leaders?,

 Sure.,

 Were very interested in your comments Mr. Prime Minister on the statements made by former American President Jimmy Carter. He called the incident with the ship the attack on the ship unprovoked and an illegal Israeli assault. He also says theres no way to realize a two-state solution while quote the people of Gaza remain isolated and deprived of basic human rights. How do you respond to President Carter?,

 Well first of all I think hes wrong on the incident. I described to you what happened.,

 All right.,

 We regret the loss of life but we dont apologize for our soldiers defending themselves. And I think thats obvious. Secondly I think the people of Gaza are indeed incarcerated by Hamas. Third I removed all the civilian -- civilian closure that we had. That is the prevention of free flow of civilian goods food medicine anything toys. I actually changed a policy that I inherited from the previous government. And it put both civilian closure on Gaza and a security closure. I said we really have to be clear about our policy. Our policy is that weapons and war-supporting material dont go in. And everything else should go in. Food and everything else should go in. So I changed that policy. And Im glad I did it because I think theres clarity and theres common sense in it. Im sorry that not everyone can see that. But I think fair minded people can see it and in fact do.,

 Does it pain you personally to have a former president of the United States be so critical of your country?,

 Well Im sorry he thinks that. I think the majority -- the overwhelming majority of Americans see things differently. I think -- I think successful presidents including this one see things differently. And the important thing is to -- is to be true to the facts. The facts are that Israel was attacked from Gaza. The fact is that we had -- that Iran sends weapons into Gaza so theyd be fired on us. The fact is that this regime Hamas is holding an Israeli soldier that they kidnapped for four years. Four years this soldier Gilad Shalit has not been allowed to see anyone. They dont allow the Red Cross to visit him. This is a complete violation of international norms. I think if anything bears condemnation it is this -- this inhumane terrorist regime. And I would hope that international condemnation is directed there. Thats where it belongs and not against Israel a struggling democracy striving to live and to make peace with its neighbors. It should not be condemned. It should be encouraged to --,

 Does it concern you Mr. Prime Minister that Israels image around the world is poor? Youre not in high regard at the U.N. You seem to be from a public relations standpoint pr standpoint in trouble.,

 Well thats one of the reasons Im appearing on THE LARRY KING show. Theres a difference between perception and reality. The reality is the people of Israel yearn for peace pray for peace. Weve not had a days peace a day of complete peace since the founding of the state in 1948. We know the cost of wars. Theres -- many Israelis have suffered it. Ive suffered it personally. Ive lost a brother in the war between the wars known as terror. Many of my friends have lost direct relatives. We know the loss of war. We know the sorrows of war. We know the blessings of peace. Yet at the same time we forged a peace agreement with Egypt. We forged a peace agreement with Jordan. And throughout these years we built a robust economy. Israel is a beehive of creativity and innovation. The economy is growing. Its one of the best performing economies in the developed world. Theres a story there that doesnt get told both of our desire for peace our sacrifices for peace and our building of a better reality. And I can envision if we had the kind of peace I envisioned with the Palestinians we could see what were seeing now in the West Bank this great prosperity envelop the entire region. I think Israel could make a tremendous contribution to the well- being of its Arab neighbors. I think peace could bring for our children my children and their children something beyond their imagination. It could be a different life a different reality. And Im prepared to do it. Im prepared to move and lead my people to that peace. I need a partner on the other side.,

 Mr. prime minister Iran how much -- the word fear apply -- how much do you fear their intentions? Do you -- do you -- whats the worst-case scenario to you?,

 Well weve learned in history and in Jewish history to take seriously those who call for our extermination. A lot of people in the past century the 20th century didnt take such calls seriously. And we know the awful price that was paid by the Jewish people and later by rest of humanity for not taking seriously these kinds of statements. The fact that after the Holocaust a sovereign government at once denies the Holocaust and calls for the destruction of the Jewish state is just outrageous. Do we take it seriously? Absolutely we take it seriously. We also know that Israel was founded to defend the Jewish people. So we reserve always the right to defend ourselves.,

 If you determined that they had nuclear capability would you attack Iran?,

 You know Ive taken note of President Obamas statement that hes determined to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. I see that sanctions have been adopted modest sanctions at the U.N. But more robust sanctions recently by the Congress was signed by the president the other day. I hope the other nations follow Americas lead in this. Will it be enough to stop the Iranian nuclear program? I cant tell you Larry. I do tell you that the president has said that all options are on the table. And I do tell you that Israel always reserves the right to defend itself. Thats the purpose for which it was founded to defend Jewish lives.,

 Assuming -- Israel has never said it has nuclear weapons but the world thinks it does. Why is it OK for Israel to have nuclear weapons and Iran not to have nuclear weapons? Hypothetically if Israel has them why is it OK for them to have them and the other not?,

 Well we said we wouldnt be the first to introduce these weapons into the Middle East. But equally were not threatening to destroy any country. We dont seek the destruction of any country or any people. We dont say that an entire people has to be wiped off the map of the Earth. We dont have such intentions. And I think all nuclear proliferation is bad. But some of it is a lot worse. It does make a difference whether Holland has nuclear weapons or the Ayatollah regime that sponsored terrorism and calls for Israels destruction whether it is nuclear weapons. And I think theres a common understanding right now something that I spoke about 16 years ago 14 years -- to be precise 1996 when I was elected 14 years ago. I spoke before the joint session of the U.S. Congress. I was just elected prime minister. And I said that the greatest threat facing humanity is that Iran would acquire nuclear weapons. Some eyebrows were raised at the time. I can tell you 14 years later that most of the worlds leaders today agree with this. There is a question of the distance between understanding and effective action and that is the ultimate test of leadership and history.,

 Would you ban all nuclear weapons throughout the -- the world -- would you ban nuclear weaponry entirely?,

 Well thats beyond my scope. I mean this is -- this is a worthy cause but its -- its a very complicated issue. And Im sure you realize that the most important thing is preventing the most dangerous weapons in the world from falling into the hands of the most dangerous regimes. And this is what we really are facing today. Were facing the prospect that people who talk about destruction who deny the Holocaust who sponsor terrorism everywhere who shoot their own citizens on the sidewalk -- you know they lie there. Remember that young woman lying there choking in her own blood. These people who have absolutely no inhibitions about the use of violence and brutality would acquire the weapons of mass terror the ultimate mass terror weapons which is atomic bombs. Thats a very very dangerous development for all of us.,

 Would there be any point -- may sound ridiculous but speaking is better than killing. Would there be any point for you to sit down with Ahmadinejad?,

 Well if he wanted to change the policies of Iran. We used to have friendly relations with Iran. It actually recognized Israel. We had exchanges all the time. But you know tell me -- when Ahmadinejad decides to recognize the state of Israel and seek peace with it believe me Ill be there eagerly waiting. But Im afraid I dont see that. I see the very opposite. ,

 Were back with Benjamin Netanyahu prime minister of Israel. So thankful to give us this hour tonight on LARRY KING LIVE. As we say we go back a long way. What do you make of Iraq -- no no well Im leaving LARRY KING LIVE in November. But Im going to be around. Were going to do specials. Were going to come to the Middle East.,

 Oh good. Good Ill -- then Ill entertain you again in Israel. It will be a good refresher.,

 It will be my pleasure. Dont forget you committed if we can get all three leaders on together were going to do that show.,

 You can do it anytime. You have one.,

 OK. Are you -- well I think we can get Jordan. If we get -- were fine if we get Abbas. What do you make of whats going to happen in Iraq? Will that hold together?,

 I hope so. I mean we are -- we are rooting for the success of the American effort and of the Iraqi effort to stabilize Iraq. It went through a very difficult period. We want to see a peaceful Middle East. We want to see a moderate Middle East. I think theres a larger battle taking place between the forces of modernity and the forces of Medievalism. Theres no other word that I could use to describe this militancy that tries not merely to eradicate Israel but to bring down any moderate government in the Arab world and in the Middle East. In a way theres a -- this is the first time in my lifetime that the -- many of the Arab governments and Israel understand that theres a great -- a great foe that threatens all of us. And that is the basis of a broader understanding. I dont think peace should be merely forged by common dangers. It should be forged also by the benefits the blessings of peace economic blessings the human blessings of every sort. But today the context of the peace is made perhaps more likely and more possible because of this common enemy that threatens Israel and Arab countries alike.,

 Whats -- what about Hezbollah Lebanon that -- four years since the war with Hezbollah and Lebanon. Are you still concerned about them?,

 Unfortunately yes because it is basically an Iranian terror proxy. Look Lebanon was the Switzerland of the Middle East. It had -- its a very beautiful country. It had robust economy. And Iran has moved its surrogates Hezbollah into Lebanon. It has piled weapons there. They fire those weapons on Israel. They undermine any attempt at moderation any movement towards peace. We always hoped that Lebanon -- we always said we dont know who the first country to make peace with Israel which country that would be but certainly Lebanon would be the second country. And you know it hasnt happened not because many Lebanese dont want it but because radical forces pro-Iranian forces like Hezbollah are preventing it. And so you have these two enclaves next to Israel one in the south Gaza controlled by one proxy of Hezbollah preventing the people there from making peace with Israel. And then another enclave in the north in Lebanon controlled by another Iranian proxy Hezbollah preventing the Lebanese from making peace with Israel and threatening to throw the entire region into a maelstrom of violence and terror. Thats happened before. I hope it doesnt happen again. But Hezbollah and Hamas are basically Iranian surrogates. As long as Iran doesnt want peace they dont want peace.,

 Touch some other bases before you leave as we have one segment to go. Youve invited President Obama to to visit Israel. What has he said?,

 Well you know hell decide the appropriate time. But I have to tell you that we had a very very very productive conversation. And I think that when we have a chance to sit as we do one on one I think its very very productive for Israel for the United States and for the quest for peace.,

 Couple of other things Mr. prime minister. How would you describe the relationship of your country with Secretary of State Clinton? And how do you measure her work in the peace process?,

 I greatly respect Secretary Clinton. You know I worked with her husband Bill. I got to know Hillary on her visits to Israel. Shes always a welcomed guest. I think shes knowledgeable. I think Secretary Clinton was a very wise choice on the part of President Obama. And well be happy to work with her if the president so designates and he often does.,

 Theres some video getting a lot of attention on the web supposedly of Israeli soldiers dancing while on patrol in Hebron. What do you know of that?,

 I dont know. I hear it for the first time.,

 So do I. They gave me a note here and said its on the web.,

 I dont know. If you talk to me -- if you want to invite me again I will be able to respond to it. ,

 Well invite you any time. Are you ever able -- youre prime minister of Israel. A previous prime minister was assassinated. You live in the center of a hostile world. Are you ever able to really relax?,

 Yeah. You know yes. And Ill tell you when. Every Saturday our Sabbath we have a day off. Its a very good idea that this institution was brought into the world. So I have a day off. And every Saturday I take an hour and a half and I read from the Bible with my younger boy. He has just won the National Bible Championship in Israel and he came third in the international. Its like the big spelling bee you know huge. I relax then. I draw a lot of spiritual strength. You know I used to teach him. He is now 15. But in the last couple of years he teaches me. So yes I draw enormous reservoirs of strength and I think that is needed for all leaders but especially for the leaders of Israel.,

 Four years ago the former prime minister Ariel Sharon suffered a stroke. He is still alive. Do you ever go to see him? What is that story?,

 Its a tragedy. Ariel Sharon was one of the great leaders of Israel. Hes in my judgment the greatest general that Israel has had in modern times. He has contributed a lot to the country. And unfortunately he suffered as you say the stroke. We can all pray that somehow he miraculously recovers. But that has not happened yet. But I think the people of Israel value his contributions. I certainly do.,

 Earlier in the program you mentioned that Hamas is still holding Gilad Shalit -- I believe thats the way you pronounce his name -- the Israeli soldier they captured four years ago.,

 Yes.,

 Any late word on any efforts?,

 Well weve had a German mediator very able man trying to broker the release. Im prepared to release 1000 Palestinian prisoners for Gilad. But so far theres not been an official response of Hamas to this offer that the mediator has made. I have accepted it. They have not. I can only hope that they change their mind.,

 In our remaining moments Mr. prime minister do you think -- how old are you now?,

 Im 60 years old Larry. And showing it.,

 Do you think that in your lifetime you will really see peace in your region?,

 I think its possible to achieve it yes. Will we achieve it with the entire Middle East? That I cannot say. Can we achieve it with the Palestinians? I say absolutely. I say that with conviction because I think its a question of a rightness for our peoples perspective. There is already time. Its now. I think for many Palestinians the time is now. And Im prepared to make that effort. It requires a lot of courage. Maybe thats the quality that supersedes all others. Because if you dont have courage everything else fails. But if you have it then everything else is possible. We have the courage to make peace. And I hope -- I fervently hope that our Palestinian neighbors have similar courage. With the help of the United States I think it can be done yeah. Absolutely.,

 Thank you Mr. prime minister. Have a safe trip home. We hope to see you again very soon.,

 Thank you. Come and visit us Larry. Thank you.,
