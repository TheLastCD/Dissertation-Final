He never written we never knew he wrote a novel, INTERVIEWEE, " No no I happened upon it Hunter and I it was when I was researching "Fear and Loathing" in Las Vegas and I was living in his basement you know and I happened upon this box As we were looking through the manuscript of "Fear and Loathing" and I see this you know folder,INTERVIEWER, " "Rum Diary" across it in his hand I thought wow whats that? You know so we started to read it sitting you know cross-legged on the floor You know reading this amazing thing And hes like my god thats pretty good isnt it?

But then he brought up the idea of you know he used to call me Colonel Colonel Depp you know As a colonel we must produce this Well produce this together Itll be our you know so that was the plan Did he know you were going to do it?,INTERVIEWEE, " It took a little while And you know years years happened And then Hunter made his exit you know So he never got to ,INTERVIEWER, " Did you kind of make a promise that youd make it?,INTERVIEWEE, " Yes Absolutely Yes,INTERVIEWER, " So this is a commitment?,INTERVIEWEE, " For sure No this was this was fulfilling a commitment to hunter This was absolutely a major promise we are going to produce this thing together And I even so far as to have you know I mean Hunter had his chair on set every day with his name on it He had his script there with his name on it He had there was a bottle of Chivas there every day A highball glass filled with rocks And wed bang in the Chivas We had his Dunhills we had his cigarette filters,INTERVIEWER, " Its a very unusual film youll agree with that,INTERVIEWEE, " It is yes,INTERVIEWER, " People will react different ways to it,INTERVIEWEE, " I think so yes,INTERVIEWER, " So explain to the uninitiated who Hunter Thompson was?,INTERVIEWEE, " He was without question I mean I think the most important nonfiction writer of the of the 20th century,INTERVIEWER, " When he died you you blew his ashes?,INTERVIEWEE, " Yes,INTERVIEWER, " How did you come to do that?,INTERVIEWEE, " It was ,INTERVIEWER, " From a cannon?,INTERVIEWEE, " Yes Built a cannon He it was his last request You know? And it was something that wed talked about here and there But I knew that thats what he wanted And I knew that that had to be done at whatever you know at whatever cost So I met with some you know some kind of architectural wizards and stuff And we built we devised a cannon of 153 feet in the shape of the gonzo fist that would shoot Hunter into the stratosphere,INTERVIEWER, " Did it make a big sound?,INTERVIEWEE, " Oh boy It was huge " He came down all over all of us You know we were covered in Hunters ashes But the idea also is to take Hunter you know his ashes and then mix that in with gun powder there was something so poetic about that You know its something so kind of symmetrical about Hunter becoming basically large bullets " That he would have loved So I mean it was again it was something that I knew that had to be done and we got it done yes,INTERVIEWER, " Hes gone from pumping gas to being one of the highest-paid actors in the world,INTERVIEWEE, " I havent changed Im still exactly the guy that used to pump gas you know Im still the guy that was a mechanic for a minute you know Im still exactly I just happen to have a weird weirder job at the moment,INTERVIEWER, " And Johnny tells us the latest on the "Lone Ranger" Finally back on?

You should play Hamlet I said I dont know you know Hamlets the kind of cliche thing He said no man Do it before youre too old to do it He said I never got the chance I never did it You should do it Go do it And so that still sticks in my head is the possibility of you know before Im too long in the tooth to play Hamlet Its just ,INTERVIEWER, " Have you ,INTERVIEWEE, " Have I?,INTERVIEWER, " Yes,INTERVIEWEE, " Yes Every time Me?

Why does he not,INTERVIEWER, " Because hes the slave,INTERVIEWEE, " Right And I couldnt stand that always And my approach to Tonto is that hes this sort of theres sort of a crazy like a fox stoicism to Tonto you know that that Tonto probably believes that the Lone Ranger is his slave his sidekick So hes like go get me the thing No no no,INTERVIEWER, " Hes going to say no?,INTERVIEWEE, " You go get it You go" Youre the one dressed in the funny outfit You do it,INTERVIEWER, " Are they going to do the beginning where all these bunch of rangers are killed and Tonto saves the Lone Rangers life and ,INTERVIEWEE, " Yes Theres certainly elements of that yes for sure You remember it well,INTERVIEWER, " Oh is there a love interest?,INTERVIEWEE, " Not for Tonto,INTERVIEWER, " I see he doesnt get one,INTERVIEWEE, " Not for Tonto no,INTERVIEWER, " Will you do your own Tonto makeup?,INTERVIEWEE, " Will I do my own Tonto makeup?,INTERVIEWER, " Have you figured out will Tonto one little feather?,INTERVIEWEE, " I think its a little more than that I think Ill tell you what Ill send you a picture of it,INTERVIEWER, " Please,INTERVIEWEE, " Ive done some tests Ill send you a picture of it Because its its a little its a little different than that What I like about Tonto what I feel good about in terms of Tonto is that I feel like hes you know when I when I came up with Captain Jack I thought OK Ive really arrived at something you know different here you know And Tonto feels right on par with Captain Jack It feels like another Captain Jack to me,INTERVIEWER, Are you doing a film about Dr Seuss?,INTERVIEWEE, Its something yes something were developing With Seusss widow you know Guiseles widow And its a very exciting possibility Because its a sort of combination of live action and ,INTERVIEWER, Cat in the Hat?,INTERVIEWEE, Not "Cat in the Hat" so much but the characters The characters will certainly have a role,INTERVIEWER, Thank you Johnny,INTERVIEWEE, Thank you What a pleasure What an honor,INTERVIEWER, Lets go around then,INTERVIEWEE, That was fine really yes,INTERVIEWER, How are you?,INTERVIEWEE, Good,INTERVIEWER, Thank you so much for being on the program tonight This is an exciting night Here’s how dumb I am I didn’t realize that when you wanted to be in show business it was going to be as a musician You are a musician and that’s what you thought you would be  a famous whatever musician,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah since I was about twelve,INTERVIEWER, Twelve years old And what are your instruments? Do you play multiple instruments?,INTERVIEWEE, Mostly guitar,INTERVIEWER, You started in Kentucky? Is that where you started?,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah  yeah I think it was,INTERVIEWER, And then you went where? Where did you go from Kentucky?,INTERVIEWEE, South Florida,INTERVIEWER, And then you went to Hollywood? Los Angeles?,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah,INTERVIEWER, And you were going to be a music star,INTERVIEWEE, Well  not necessarily I was going to be a guitar player,INTERVIEWER, You were going to be a guitar player And where did you see yourself as a guitar player? As a really good  like a studio guy?,INTERVIEWEE, Not necessarily good  no,INTERVIEWER, Oh not good?,INTERVIEWEE, I was all right,INTERVIEWER, But you’d never thought about acting?,INTERVIEWEE, Never once No,INTERVIEWER, That’s crazy isn’t it?,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah  it is now,INTERVIEWER, So what was the turning moment? You’re out there in California you have your guitar and suddenly you’re an actor  ?,INTERVIEWEE, Well the sudden realization of you know rent Bills You know when that pops in your head you realize that at some point you’ll have to deal with the inevitable,INTERVIEWER, But you know that story often goes the other way Somebody goes out there to be an actor and suddenly they’ve got no money so they go to play the guitar to make money You did it just the opposite!,INTERVIEWEE, Weirdly,INTERVIEWER, How did somebody get your first gig if you were a guitar player? Because that means you weren’t actually out there auditioning,INTERVIEWEE, No uh  my band moved from Florida to Los Angeles,INTERVIEWER, What was the name of the band?,INTERVIEWEE, At the time we were called The Kids,INTERVIEWER, The Kids?,INTERVIEWEE, We actually were kids at the time,INTERVIEWER, And so you and The Kids are out there,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah,INTERVIEWER, Well I mean literally you and The Kids are out there and so then what happens?,INTERVIEWEE, Uh we did some opening act stuff that kind of thing—,INTERVIEWER, Who did you work for?,INTERVIEWEE, Open up for? We did some good shows back at that time—it was like Billy Idol and you know guys like that The Pretenders—,INTERVIEWER, Wow,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah Ramones—,INTERVIEWER, Good gig So then all of a sudden you’re—somebody calls and says what? “I saw you onstage with The Kids?”,INTERVIEWEE, No No I was dead broke you know and I was filling out job applications at various  well anything Video stores and coffee joints or whatever And a friend of mine who happened to be an actor uh  Nicolas Cage  [smiling] you’ve heard of him—,INTERVIEWER, Yeah How did you and Nicolas Cage get to be buddies in those days?,INTERVIEWEE, He was just sort of around all the people that I was hanging around with and we became pals and he sent me to his agent to—and he said “I think you should try acting” And I met his agent and she sent me to read for something and they hired me,INTERVIEWER, What was that? Do you remember what that was?,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah That was A Nightmare on Elm Street The first one,INTERVIEWER, Whoa! [Audience applause] That was pretty good!,INTERVIEWEE, I was about three when I did that,INTERVIEWER, Later we’ve got a man named Bill Carter who is well known in Texas music and southwestern music or what they call Americana I guess—,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah,INTERVIEWER, A singer-songwriter and you met him  where? Where did your paths meet?,INTERVIEWEE, Bill and I met—Bill and Ruth Carter—,INTERVIEWER, His wife? Partner?,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah They’re amazing songwriters and I met them when I was doing Gilbert Grape in Austin [audience applause] and we all just hit it off And so they were my kind of saving grace during that period because it was a long movie  and so we did the movie and then I moved in with them for a few months,INTERVIEWER, Amazing Your movies are interesting movies and huge commercial successes and rarely do you get that combination consistently,INTERVIEWEE, It’s got nothing to do with me I don’t think,INTERVIEWER, All right Johnny Depp is here  I can’t thank you enough for being here It’s a nice night for us and I hope for you as well because you’re here with your friend—,INTERVIEWEE, Yes sir,INTERVIEWER, and we’re going to hear some music later Let’s talk about The Lone Ranger Oh I’m so excited for this movie I really—this is excellent And you’re not the Lone Ranger,INTERVIEWEE, I’m not,INTERVIEWER, You’re his faithful companion Tonto,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah I play Tonto,INTERVIEWER, Do you mind if I just show these?,INTERVIEWEE, Oh Sure,INTERVIEWER, These are great [Holding up a photo of Johnny as Tonto and Armie Hammer as the Ranger] And then the Lone Ranger is  who’s the Lone Ranger?,INTERVIEWEE, Armie Hammer Yeah—,INTERVIEWER, And that’s you,INTERVIEWEE, —he’s terrific Yeah He’s great,INTERVIEWER, Now as I recall the beginning of the—the genesis of the Lone Ranger is he comes from a dark story And is that the tone of your film?,INTERVIEWEE, Pretty much yeah It comes from a very dark back story and  uh  he becomes the Lone Ranger through Tonto’s guidance,INTERVIEWER, Did this mean anything to you when you were a kid? Maybe after the radio broadcast but there was a TV show as well  did you like The Lone Ranger in those days?,INTERVIEWEE, I did I liked watching the series I was always somewhat confused about Tonto’s position I always thought well why does Tonto go in the house and do this? Why is he sending the Indian off to—,INTERVIEWER, Right And is that different in this movie?,INTERVIEWEE, Oh very Yeah It’s very different,INTERVIEWER, This looks like a painting This looks like a Charles Russell rendering doesn’t it? That’s fantastic! [Long audience applause] You look like you know what you’re doing on a horse,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah [Pause] I don’t [Audience laughter] That [indicating the picture] was probably about two-and-a-half seconds before everything went very sideways,INTERVIEWER, Well I’m telling you I mean forget the movie—I’d pay ten bucks just to look at this picture [Johnny laughs] So  but you ride You don’t ride?,INTERVIEWEE, I have  no no I’ve ridden quite a lot in various movies and stuff  and you know growing up in Kentucky you grow up around horses and everything But every horse is different and every movie,INTERVIEWER, You had to ride that horse at top speed?,INTERVIEWEE, Quite a lot Yeah,INTERVIEWER, How did that go?,INTERVIEWEE, It went pretty well  up and to a point Yeah There was one moment in particular where it got unpleasant where the horses had been running  we’d been running them all day so  they weren’t really interested in slowing down At all So we’re shooting at a different place in the desert where there are all these little [gesturing]  bumps and things growing And so my horse that I was on decided to jump a couple of these little obstacles The horse was unaware that the saddle I was wearing to sit on top of it was sort of jerry-rigged  kind of faked—,INTERVIEWER, It was to give the effect that you were riding bareback?,INTERVIEWEE, To give the effect that I’m riding bareback So basically it’s not really tight on the horse it’s just enough—,INTERVIEWER, Just a little tissue there for you to sit on—,INTERVIEWEE, A band-aid And when we came down the saddle slipped you know and I went to the left and had the reins here [gesturing] and somehow had the wherewithal to grab the mane of the horse  and then the next thing I saw  [interrupting himself]  all very calm for some reason—I figured that fear would kick in but it didn’t  [Audience laughter] I was waiting  All I saw in front of my eyes were these sort of very muscular horse legs and the striations of muscles moving This kind of  [pause]  death machine And one word popped into my head: hooves You know? Hooves [Audience laughter] In any case hooves Mind the hooves,INTERVIEWER, So what do you do when you’re in that position?,INTERVIEWEE, Well you make a decision Will I go with the beast until someone wrangles it or will I drop? [Audience laughter] It’s a crapshoot,INTERVIEWER, Sure And what did you choose?,INTERVIEWEE, I dropped,INTERVIEWER, I mean you know  we’re being silly about this but you really could have been seriously seriously injured if not killed,INTERVIEWEE, Horrifically mangled at the very least,INTERVIEWER, You landed on your back? Did you get stepped on?,INTERVIEWEE, I landed on my back Hit the deck pretty hard The one thing that saved me was the horse’s instinct to lift his front legs and go over me,INTERVIEWER, He stepped over you?,INTERVIEWEE, Stepped over me Had he not it was coming straight down into the head,INTERVIEWER, Broken ribs strains bruises anything?,INTERVIEWEE, No He just kind of clipped me with his back legs so it was just a little sore,INTERVIEWER, He just “kind of clipped you with his back legs” Yeah a good horse’ll do that Oh my God But honest to God where are the stunt people for heaven’s sakes? You’re Tonto!,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah,INTERVIEWER, You don’t need that,INTERVIEWEE, That’s the exact same question I asked,INTERVIEWER, Johnny I wanted to  you’re now publishing  I know you have a love of books and you have published this New York Times bestseller already This is a lost novel from Woody Guthrie?,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah,INTERVIEWER, About the Dust Bowl?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes,INTERVIEWER, How did you find the transcript of this?,INTERVIEWEE, It came to me through a mutual friend of Hunter Thompson’s and myself this guy named Douglas Brinkley who’s a brilliant writer and historian professor  he’s just amazing So he called me and said “I’ve just been shown the manuscript to Woody Guthrie’s lost novel  I think you’re the guy I think we should publish it” And so we went into it and just wanted to make the book as you know beautiful as possible since they’re a dying breed these things,INTERVIEWER, You have plans to publish other volumes different things?,INTERVIEWEE, We have a couple of things in line There’s a thing we’re doing with Bob Dylan which should be interesting,INTERVIEWER, And the other thing  Last night we had a group on doing sea chanteys,INTERVIEWEE, Exactly,INTERVIEWER, From—the Americans from a collection of sea chanteys which you produced  and not only did I not know that you had produced it this is the second collection of sea chanteys—,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah “Rogues Gallery” and—,INTERVIEWER, This is the “Son of Rogues Gallery”,INTERVIEWEE, “Son of Rogues”,INTERVIEWER, This is music that you came to when you were doing the Pirates of the Caribbean series?,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah on Pirates 1 I was listening to a lot of sea chanteys just to stay in the feel of this and Gore and I—the director and I thought Wow wouldn’t it be great to have contemporary artists do this stuff?,INTERVIEWER, Anytime I’ve seen you—in a trailer at your home in a hotel room—you always have at least one guitar with you You sometimes talk while strumming a guitar How connected are you with music?,INTERVIEWEE, It’s still my first love as much as it ever was since I was a little kid and first picked up a guitar and tried to figure out how to make the thing go Going into acting was an odd deviation from a particular road that I was on in my late teens early 20s because I had no desire no interest really in it at all I was a musician and I was a guitarist and that’s what I wanted to do But because of that deviation and because I don’t do it for a living maybe I still have been able to maintain that kind of innocent love for it The weird thing is I think I approach my work the same way I approached guitar playing—looking at a character like a song If you think of expression musically—it goes from wherever it comes from inside to your fingers and on to that fretboard and then on to the amplifier through whatever It’s the same kind of thing that’s required here with acting: What was the author’s intent? What can I add to it that maybe someone else won’t add to it? It’s not necessarily a question of how many notes but a question of what do the notes express and what does a slight bend do,INTERVIEWER, I overheard someone in your camp—maybe it was on the set of The Rum Diary or maybe it was The Tourist—talking about how eager you were to get back to Captain Jack and about how much Jack was like you How do you feel when you enter into the skin of Captain Jack?,INTERVIEWEE, Free—free to be irreverent I think it’s like unlocking a part of yourself and freeing this part of yourself to just be—what do they call it?—the id or whatever just to be  just to be under whatever circumstances The closest thing that I can compare it to was having known Hunter Thompson really well—we were very very close—and witnessing him because I studied him so deeply and lived with him for a period of time to try to become Raoul Duke to try to become Hunter There was a certain freedom that he had or control or command of the situation—there was never anything that he couldn’t get through Verbally he was just so clever and so quick and so free and he didn’t give a rat’s ass about what the repercussions were,INTERVIEWER, He was the revolutionary’s Johnny Carson I mean he always had a punch line,INTERVIEWEE, Somebody once asked him “What is the sound of one hand clapping Hunter?” and he smacked him Captain Jack was kind of like that for me an opening up of this part of yourself that is somewhat—you know there is a little Bugs Bunny in all of us,INTERVIEWER, Young kids love—really love—the Captain And who is more mystically mischievous and brilliant in his own way than Bugs Bunny?,INTERVIEWEE, At the time I had been watching nothing but cartoons with my daughter—with Lily Rose I hadn’t seen a grown-up film in forever It was all cartoons all those great old Warner Bros things And I thought Jesus the parameters here are so much wider and more forgiving in terms of character These cartoon characters could get away with anything And I thought They’re beloved by 3-year-olds and 93-year-olds How do you do that? How do you get there? That was kind of the start,INTERVIEWER, I also see a little bit of John Barrymore in Captain Jack There’s humor and often a feyness He keeps his intelligence in his own little treasure chest He doesn’t really want people to comprehend that he knows everything,INTERVIEWEE, He has already assessed the situation,INTERVIEWER, What were you reading to inform you about Captain Jack’s life or his lifestyle?,INTERVIEWEE, I was reading a lot of books about early pirates There was one book in particular that was really helpful called Under the Black Flag You realize that those guys were—you either loved it or you were press-ganged and you didn’t One of the things that helped me most with Captain Jack was a book by Bernard Moitessier and it’s where I found the last line for the first Pirates movie The writers were stumped and they’d say Well what about this? And nothing seemed to click I was reading this Moitessier book on sailing the earth and he had written about how the ultimate for a sailor was the horizon and to be able to attain that horizon which you never get to which is why it keeps pushing you forward I thought That’s it! That’s it! So I went to them and said I’ve got a line for you: “Bring me that horizon” And they looked at it and went Nah that’s not it But about 45 minutes later they came to me and went That’s the line,INTERVIEWER, Because delivered in a certain way  ,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah—“Bring me that horizon” That’s what they all want That’s what all those guys want Get me that horizon And you never get there,INTERVIEWER, How did Disney feel about Captain Jack? He does have a wisp of controversy about him,INTERVIEWEE, It was a totally different regime over there at the time They couldn’t stand him They just couldn’t stand him I think it was Michael Eisner the head of Disney at the time who was quoted as saying “He’s ruining the movie” It was that extreme—memos and paper trails and madness and phone calls and agents and lawyers and people screaming and me getting phone calls direct from you know upper-echelon Disney-ites going What’s wrong with him? Is he you know like some kind of weird simpleton? Is he drunk? By the way is he gay? Is he this? Is he that? And so I actually told this woman who was the Disney-ite that called me about all that stuff and asked me the questions I said to her “But didn’t you know that all my characters are gay?” Which really made her nervous,INTERVIEWER,The role of Frank in The Tourist is so different from the Hatter or the Captain—more subtle Characters like him—who seem to have less that you can grasp—I would think would be harder to do,INTERVIEWEE, The great challenge of a character like Frank for me is that he’s Everyman you know Mr Ordinary—not a simpleton just ordinary He’s a math teacher I was always fascinated by people who are considered completely normal because I find them the weirdest of all,INTERVIEWER, So where did you find Frank?,INTERVIEWEE, He was sort of a combo platter for me from certain people I’ve known over the years I knew an accountant who would travel—he was super-straight very very straight guy—and he would travel all over the world to photograph places that had street signs or businesses that had the same name as his last name He’d go to Italy he’d go to Shanghai and he’d take photographs That was his kick,INTERVIEWER, He had an eccentricity that no one sees Everyone sees the eccentricities of an artist But eccentricities like Frank’s are so subtle and so particular,INTERVIEWEE, It was guys like that that I thought about Frank for example who had quit smoking could be absolutely fascinated with that electronic cigarette and the moving parts of it and being able to really explain it to someone in great detail,INTERVIEWER, Frank has some really nice pajamas Cotton Light blue Do you wear pajamas?,INTERVIEWEE, Occasionally I do Occasionally when it’s cold,INTERVIEWER, Do they have feet on them?,INTERVIEWEE, I don’t have the feet I have not gone for footed pajamas yet However I’m not—I wouldn’t you know withdraw the idea One of the finest nights of sleep that I ever had after a huge workload was in a pair of pajamas that Julian Schnabel gave me I hadn’t worn pajamas since I was about three And I actually slept in them They were somehow so comforting His wife made them That was the moment when I became completely square,INTERVIEWER, Well I don’t know I’ve also seen your Miami Dolphins socks—although that might be a secret,INTERVIEWEE, You have a pair too! There are no secrets now We’re in this together,INTERVIEWER, We have another dirty little secret A Monkees song,INTERVIEWEE, Oh “Daydream Believer” It’s a great song I don’t care what anyone says,INTERVIEWER, “Daydream Believer” came on the radio when we were driving to the set It was a moment of total happiness It’s a pure happy little song What bad thing can you say about it?,INTERVIEWEE, I know I know It’s OK to like “Daydream Believer” There’s nothing wrong with a guilty pleasure from time to time Know what I mean? It’s “Daydream Believer” I’m justifying my own flag,INTERVIEWER, A Monkee and I have the same birthday  ,INTERVIEWEE, Is it Micky Dolenz?,INTERVIEWER, No it’s actually two Monkees Mike and Davy I used to be horrified by that fact but now I don’t care anymore I have the same birthday as Bo Diddley Rudyard Kipling and Paul Bowles  and two Monkees,INTERVIEWEE, That’s pretty good That’s a good balance,INTERVIEWER, Getting back to The Tourist from what I saw on set the atmosphere seemed fraught with mischief,INTERVIEWEE, Angelina—we’d met basically on this film Meeting her and getting to know her was a real pleasant surprise and I say that with the best meaning just in the sense that she’s this quite you know famous and I mean poor thing dogged by paparazzi her and her husband Brad you know and all their kids and their wonderful life but they are plagued by  so you don’t know what to expect really You don’t know what she might be like—if she has any sense of humor at all I was so pleased to find that she is incredibly normal and has a wonderfully kind of dark perverse sense of humor And because here we are working together in this situation where you could really—there are times when you see how ridiculous is this life how ludicrous it is you know leaving your house every morning and being followed by paparazzi or having to hide sometimes not even being able to talk to each other in public because someone will take a photograph and it will be misconstrued and turned into some other shit,INTERVIEWER, On set I told her that she looked beautiful and she explained to me about all the different people it takes to make that possible—as if she really isn’t I found Angelina interesting If you talk about her beauty she scoffs If you mention a cause she invites you to take a stand,INTERVIEWEE, That’s the thing with Angie I mean you look at her and you go OK: “goddess” “movie icon” In 30 years people will still be going “Oh my God” Elizabeth Taylor kind of territory And she has got that no question about it But like anything it’s the way she deals with it She’s so down to earth and so bright and so real I’ve had the honor and the pleasure and gift of having known Elizabeth Taylor for a number of years Who’s a real broad You know you sit down with her she slings hash she sits there and cusses like a sailor and she’s hilarious Angie’s got the same kind of thing you know the same approach,INTERVIEWER, Something I’ve always wondered about is: these people that you become for us or make flesh in a film—do they revisit you ever? Are you able to discard them? What happens to them?,INTERVIEWEE, They’re all still there which on some level can’t be the healthiest thing in the world But no they’re all still there I always picture it as this chest of drawers in your body—Ed Wood is in one the Hatter is in another Scissorhands is in another They stick with you Hunter is certainly in there—you know Raoul Duke The weirdest thing is that I can access them They’re still very close to the surface,INTERVIEWER, It must be difficult when you have multiple personalities in one of them like the Hatter has What does he say “It’s crowded in here”?,INTERVIEWEE, “I don’t like it in here It’s terribly crowded” But they all somehow have their place They have come to terms with each other I suppose,INTERVIEWER, When you’re playing someone—when you’re really deep within a character—have you ever had a dream that you felt was not your dream? Do your characters dream within you?,INTERVIEWEE, I’ve certainly had dreams where I was the character Sweeney was like that There were a lot of dark Sweeney dreams And certainly The Libertine playing John Wilmot,INTERVIEWER, I would think that Wilmot would be the one who would most desire to rear his head He was a real human being It’s one thing to interpret a character in literature or someone in fiction But to have to channel someone who was a living person Did you find that process different?,INTERVIEWEE, It’s definitely different The first thing is the responsibility You have a responsibility to that person and the legacy and memory of that person So especially playing someone like John Wilmot the Earl of Rochester because I always felt he was this great great poet who was never acknowledged as a great poet but looked upon as a satirist or some silly guy who hung around the court of King Charles II I never believed he got his due He was a renegade a brilliant poet who was incredibly brave I felt this very strong responsibility to play him right—so much so that I became obsessed I read everything I knew everything about him I went to the places he’d lived I went to the place where he died I perused his actual letters in the British Library and found his words and made notes and used them in the script Without wanting to sound all kind of New Agey I do believe that he paid me at least a few visits,INTERVIEWER, When you spouted a few lines of poetry to Samantha Morton who played Elizabeth Barry in the movie—that was my introduction to Wilmot’s work to his poetry And I noticed in Alice when the Hatter recites “Jabberwocky” that you have a gift for giving us the full measure of a poet’s work It is really quite difficult Could you imagine doing a recording of works of poetry?,INTERVIEWEE, I don’t know It’s daunting because you don’t know exactly  I mean you can decipher the intent and you can kind of swim around in the guts of it but you just don’t know how the poet would have wanted it read,INTERVIEWER, Yes but that’s no different than Glenn Gould having to anticipate how Bach would want his work played I thought the Hatter’s reading of “Jabberwocky” was luminous Yesterday you read me a poem written by the Elephant Man I didn’t know he wrote poetry The poem you recited was heartbreaking How did you come to find it?,INTERVIEWEE, I made an appointment at the hospital where they had his remains His skeleton is there a plaster mask is there and his hat and veil and all this other stuff is there And right on the wall next to him is this gorgeous poem that he wrote about himself and about his life: “Dragging this vile body / Round the years / I am not what first appears / A senseless freak / Devoid of hope or tears” This guy was deep and so so gifted,INTERVIEWER, I’ve seen The Libertine a number of times The cinematography the direction the script—it was all so beautiful The costumes the casting the women—they were superb John Malkovich was a great person for you to work off of But it seemed buried as a film,INTERVIEWEE, It was buried no question It was buried horribly It was a conflict within the ranks I wanted to go to the artist Banksy the English graffiti artist I was going to make a plea to him What I wanted was the image the spray-painted image of John Wilmot’s face to show up here and there simply with the line from the movie the phrase “You will not like me” “You will not like me”—I thought That’s the way to go with something like this But the reaction was “Banksy who?”,INTERVIEWER, Do you have any actors that you studied from the past actors from any era who were helpful either in a specific role or just in general? ,INTERVIEWEE, The guys I always adored were mostly the silent-film actors Buster Keaton first Lon Chaney Sr and Chaplin of course—those three for me And John Barrymore The gods: those are the gods And then you’ve got the people that came out of that Paul Muni certainly  But Marlon it wasn’t until Marlon Brando came along that  it was revolutionary it just changed everything The work he was doing Streetcar—completely different fucking animal And everybody changed their approach from that moment on,INTERVIEWER, He was bigger than—I don’t know how to say it—it was almost like the screen could not contain him Does that make sense?,INTERVIEWEE, Absolutely I don’t know what the fuck it is or was but at that time—especially at that time—he had too much And the shape of his face and his nose and his—and the distance between his forehead and his eyebrows and whatever was going on for whatever genetic reason or whatever He was placed in that spot for that particular thing And man he cranked it He just absolutely owned it,INTERVIEWER, It’s interesting when one individual—whether it’s Michelangelo Coltrane Bob Dylan Jackson Pollock—they’re so inspiring and they help beget almost a whole school but no one can touch them They have this place of kingship but also solitude,INTERVIEWEE, And Marlon hated it He hated it which is probably why he rejected the whole idea of it you know and made fun of it But I know it’s bullshit I know he was capable of the work and worked hard when he did the work I saw him do it you know He did care,INTERVIEWER, Earlier you mentioned those three greats the silent-film greats You’re a master of language voice script words And yet you chose three silent-film actors,INTERVIEWEE, The amazing thing about those guys is that they didn’t have the luxury of language So what they were doing what they were feeling what they were trying to express had to come out through being had to be alive had to be in there behind the eyes Their body had to express it their very being had to express it,INTERVIEWER, Throughout your life you seem to have had beautiful relationships with a succession of mentors—Marlon Hunter Allen Ginsberg You hold these people with you Is that something that has just come your way? Or is it something that you seek in life?,INTERVIEWEE, I think it’s probably a combination It’s never been a conscious sort of searching but it did happen with these guys The combination probably goes back to memories of my grandfather We were very very close and I lost him I was about nine,INTERVIEWER, Is it your grandfather you have tattooed on your arm?,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah Jim He was a wonderful model He drove a bus during the day and ran moonshine at night He was a Robert Mitchum type a man’s man He just said things as they were He’d call a spade a spade—and piss on you if you don’t like it He was also of a different era—I mean a radically different era as were some of the other guys that we’ve talked about like Marlon and Hunter and even Keith [Richards] to some degree and Allen certainly I really believe it was a better time I really believe that at a certain point if you’re born in ‘60-something or whatever you got ripped off—you know what I mean? I always felt like I was meant to have been born in another era another time,INTERVIEWER, I was thinking back on Edward Scissorhands—he has this father figure and mentor Vincent Price’s character You told me a story once about Vincent Price,INTERVIEWEE, We were doing Scissorhands and Vincent was playing the inventor—essentially my father in the film And he was a decent man He was able to move around He was cool He was old,INTERVIEWER, Was that his last film?,INTERVIEWEE, I think it was yes I think it was his last,INTERVIEWER, Such a beautiful film to end with,INTERVIEWEE, And the same kind of genre that he dwelled in for a long time I adored him As did Tim a long time before me So we spent time together hung out I was totally enamored And I had this volume of Edgar Allan Poe Tales of Mystery and Imagination that I wanted to show him just show him you know because I love the illustrations by Harry Clarke I brought it to Vincent and we were sitting in his trailer He says Oh yes this is wonderful it’s a wonderful book He was leafing beautifully through these great heavy pages And he found “The Tomb of Ligeia” and started to read from it And he read about half a page aloud maybe And then he closed the book and continued He knew it verbatim,INTERVIEWER, Speaking of books I was thinking about the letters and manuscripts you have—Dylan Thomas Kerouac Rimbaud Can you remember the first of these that you obtained and how that came about?,INTERVIEWEE, It was 1991 and I was finishing a film called Arizona Dream in New York And I wanted to take a trip to Lowell Massachusetts to see Kerouac’s town I’d read everything and been inundated with the Kerouac thing And so I went there and hooked up with John Sampas who is Kerouac’s wife’s brother We talked He took me around the town We went to various bars and went to his house spent a couple of days like that At the time it was prior to all that stuff being sold off He gave me access total access to Kerouac’s things He just opened up—bam! I read the Book of Dreams that was under his bed I read it cover to cover There it was like right there in front of me,INTERVIEWER, In his handwriting?,INTERVIEWEE, Handwriting watercolors—the Book of Dreams It was right there little notepads tiny little steno notebooks that he carried in his back pocket I read cover to cover as many as I could And opened up suitcases of his that hadn’t been opened for years All these amazing things John Sampas gave me a coat so we could walk to the cemetery to visit Kerouac’s grave And the coat he put on me was Jack’s A black raincoat three-quarter length slight check in it I reached into the pockets In the right-hand pocket there was a tissue just some old wadded-up tissue And on the left-hand side there was an old matchbook And I thought you know OK I’ve touched these It’s like the Smithsonian Institution was in my pockets you know?,INTERVIEWER, Are you reading anything right now? Well you’re always reading so I should say what are you reading right now?,INTERVIEWEE, Between scripts I’m reading The Thin Man the Dashiell Hammett book to see what we can mine from it That’s something that would be Rob [Marshall] directing and me playing the Nick part My hope is that Penélope [Cruz] would play the part of Nora,INTERVIEWER, And what script are you reading?,INTERVIEWEE, The most recent draft of Dark Shadows That’s something I want to do The script is close now really close and you know it’s just a question of myself and Tim and the writer basically the three of us getting together and signing off on various scenarios But it’s really gotten good In the last three weeks it’s gotten fuckin’ good,INTERVIEWER, Do you ever think of doing plays? I think it would be wonderful to see you work live,INTERVIEWEE, I do I do I do The bitter pill that I swallowed was with Marlon who asked how many movies I did a year And I said I don’t know—three? He said You ought to slow down kid You’ve got to slow down ‘cause we only have so many faces in our pockets And then he went on to say Why don’t you just take a year and go and study Shakespeare or go and study Hamlet Go and work on Hamlet and play that part Play that part before you’re too old I thought Well yeah yeah I know Hamlet Great What a great part great play you know this and that And then the killer came He said “I never did it I never got the chance to do it Why don’t you go and do it?” He was the one that should’ve done it and he didn’t He didn’t So what he was trying to tell me was: play that fucking part man Play that part before you’re too long in the tooth Play it And I would like to I’d really really like to,INTERVIEWER, Tim Burton says the dark films youve made together have been a form of therapy. Would you agree?,INTERVIEWEE, I guess it is kind of therapeutic to go in and make an ass of yourself and get paid for it. Theres something to be said for that. As an actor with any character you play you have to bring as much of your own truth to the character as possible. And then you make an ass of yourself.,INTERVIEWER, How easy was it getting into the character of Willy Wonka?,INTERVIEWEE, Well obviously were all very lucky to have the book as our source material. Using Roald Dahls work was an amazing help in building the character. And then it was really just down to conversations with Tim. We talked about various things like memories of growing up of childrens show hosts. That strange cadence with which they spoke to children “Hello kiddies;” and game show hosts with that kind of mask they put on like a perpetual grimace. We went from there.,INTERVIEWER, Did you draw on any one person?,INTERVIEWEE, There was this guy called Captain Kangaroo. Even then it was strange but if you go back now and watch it its really out there. He had his pal Mr. Green Jeans and Bunny Rabbit. So it was memories of watching those guys as a child the game show guys who were always smiling. But no one specific.,INTERVIEWER, What about the resemblance between Willy Wonka and Michael Jackson?,INTERVIEWEE, Honestly when we were doing the film it never dawned on me that there would be any comparisons made. I dont know what more I can say about that.,INTERVIEWER, What else did you do to develop the character?,INTERVIEWEE, For me when Im reading a script I start getting images you know—ideas start coming into my head so I write everything down. The hairdo I saw early on but it took a long time before I could see or hear Wonka. I dont know thats pretty much it. You build layer upon layer as you find him. Even when we started shooting it probably took me about ten days to really feel like I clicked with the guy. The false teeth were very helpful.,INTERVIEWER, Have your children seen all your films?,INTERVIEWEE, Some of them yeah. Im not sure my kids are ready for all of them. They saw Charlie and the Chocolate Factory which made me nervous because I was scared they were going to come home and just go “Nah Dad better luck next time.” But they came home quoting it which was really nice.,INTERVIEWER, If you were as poor as Charlie Bucket is in the film do you think you could be happy?,INTERVIEWEE, When I was growing up we werent particularly overflowing with money. I never expected to last so long in this racket to be honest. I always expected to go back to playing guitar and pumping gas or whatever. And it still could happen. As long as you have the ability to breathe and life for your kids and your girl you just keep moving forward.,INTERVIEWER, So whats next for you?,INTERVIEWEE, Well at the moment Im on hiatus from shooting Pirates 2 and 3. Thats going well so far—I havent been fired which is good. And I made a film last year called The Libertine which is coming out next in December I think. Thats pretty much it at the moment.,INTERVIEWER, Have you always been interested in the dark side of life?,INTERVIEWEE, Yeah yeah. I'm interested in extremes of all kinds you know. The dark side the light side the negative and the positive. I don't know why. Human behavior really is the most fascinating thing.,INTERVIEWER, What do you think of the view that The Ripper was the very first tabloid star?,INTERVIEWEE, I agree with it. He was perversely elevated to the status of celebrity. It was the first time that had happened. The Ripper case in a way gave birth to tabloid journalism.,INTERVIEWER, From Hell is a classic London story. But where did you film it?,INTERVIEWEE, The Czech Republic! I really don't know why. All I know is that when I arrived in the Czech Republic they drove me about 30-40 minutes outside Prague to the studio and they had built 8-10 blocks of Whitechapel 1888 in staggering detail in the middle of a field.,INTERVIEWER, So what was it like to be standing there to suddenly be transported back in time?,INTERVIEWEE, It was extremely bizarre. The day before I'd been to Whitechapel in London and had visited the 10 Bells and the various murder sites the church and the general neighborhood. And then the next day I'm standing in the exact same spot except one hundred and something years earlier. It was so beautifully done. The detail was amazing.,INTERVIEWER, Do you mean you went on The Ripper Tour?,INTERVIEWEE, Kind of. I went with one of the experts the Ripper-ologists. He took me on the walk and explained all the details because a lot of the murder sites are now gone. There are buildings on top of them.,INTERVIEWER, We hear that you hang out in London quite a lot and we were wondering why you particularly like the city?,INTERVIEWEE, It's easy to like it just look at it! It's an amazing place amazing people. When we did Sleepy Hollow I was here for six months and that was one of the greatest times I've ever had. It's beautiful it's got great history great people an interesting culture the list is endless.,INTERVIEWER, And is it right that you're going to open a bar here?,INTERVIEWEE, I just heard that today and that's the first I'd heard of it! A couple of people have said to me “How's the bar going?” and I thought they meant The Viper Room in Los Angeles. I'm always coming across small fictions like that about me. It's part of the deal I guess.,INTERVIEWER, So let's talk about Robbie Coltrane—you've said he's your hero—why do you think he's such a cool guy?,INTERVIEWEE, He's the perfect example of what a man should be. He's a great man a loyal man he's a great actor a great comedian a beautiful friend a beautiful father. He's amazing. I'm going to call him 'BAFTA Coltrane' from now on. I'm sure he'll clean up at the Academy Awards.,INTERVIEWER, On the set of From Hell you had Robbie from Harry Potter and Ian Holm from Lord Of The Rings. Did you find out much insider gossip from those films?,INTERVIEWEE, Ian showed me these photographs of himself in his prosthetic makeup which was pretty impressive. And I got a few Harry Potter stories out of old Coltrane. But I still haven't seen the films yet. I don't go to the movies so much. They'll come around at some point. I prefer the comfort of ignorance in terms of the industry. I don't like knowing which movies are making money. I don't like knowing what the new thing is who's popular who's not popular. I find great comfort in not knowing these things.,INTERVIEWER, What interested you about From Hell?,INTERVIEWEE, I thought the script was amazing and I’m a big fan of the Hughes Brothers. I loved their last film (American Pimp) and I loved working with them. I also got the chance to smoke a lot in this movie like in Blow. I don’t need an excuse to smoke in a film.,INTERVIEWER, You were interested in Jack the Ripper as a child?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes I was very fascinated by the subject of Jack the Ripper I was obsessed maybe I was too interested in him at such a young age. From then on I just found as much information on the subject as I could over the years. It’s the first recorded serial killer in history and the fact that’s it’s never been properly solved is really fascinating. Nothing like this had happened before on such a large scale and it’s still an unsolved case and it’s a case that will likely never fully be solved.,INTERVIEWER, Abberline is a very sick tortured man in the film? Tell us how you approached the character.,INTERVIEWEE, Even in the deepest and darkest kinds of things I try to find some humor and extract it. The character I play Abberline feels like he sees demons and visions in his search for Jack the Ripper. He’s a very damaged man so in a way from my point of view it would make sense to show all of his scars and weaknesses. He has all of these demons he abuses drugs you show the addictions and the demons—as well as the hunt for the killer.,INTERVIEWER, You did a lot of research for this role didn’t you?,INTERVIEWEE, One of the things I was able to do was actually go and visit Whitechapel and see the real places where the killings took place. I also got to talk to all of these ‘Ripperologists’ and hear all of these theories about who Jack the Ripper may have been. One of the Jack the Ripper experts he took me to all of the notorious landmarks where all the murders happened.,INTERVIEWER, What did the Hughes Brothers bring to the film?,INTERVIEWEE, They knew every theory in the film. They’re great. They know everything about what they’re doing. They study scenes. They told me that they had reconstructed Whitechapel for the movie but I didn’t know just how far they had gone. It turns out you could see seven or eight blocks of the East End of London. It felt like stepping back into time. I was so impressed with the research they had done for the film. It was like watching someone solve a hard equation.,INTERVIEWER, Why is the legend of the Jack the Ripper still so fascinating?,INTERVIEWEE, It was the first case where a faceless killer had been elevated to the status of pulp icon. He became a worldwide curiosity.,INTERVIEWER, So From Hell was a much happier experience than The Astronaut’s Wife and The Ninth Gate?,INTERVIEWEE, Yes.,INTERVIEWER, Tell us a little about working with Tim Burton.,INTERVIEWEE, I’d love to work with Tim again. Tim’s a true artist very true to his artistic vision to his emotions. He’s proved that you can do things differently and still be successful. On Sleepy Hollow I thought I was going to get fired because I didn’t think there was any way they were going to let me play the character that way but Tim was very supportive. The same was true with the Hughes Brothers. Anything they did I’d work with them again.,
